*'Who has prepared this evening meal?* asks the seeker.

*A man*, responds the sage. *

Dost know his name?* asks the seeker.

*Not I. His name is not spoken. 


He is more silence than speech.

He is above name.

What food has he prepared for 
this feast?

Himself, no less than himself,* says Meister Eckhart.




*The moral is that those who live the life of 


the five senses never taste this 
food.'*

[Meister Eckhart](/western-mystics#Meister Eckhart 1260-1328)


In the previous chapter, *'**[Atman, 
Job & the Son of Shame](/ouroboros/atman-job-son-of-shame)**,'* 
I proposed that within human consciousness lies the potential for profound 
self-awareness—a state in which consciousness directly mirrors itself through 
experiencing its own act of perception.



Nietzsche famously stated: *"If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also 
gazes into you,"* and further cautioned, *"He who fights with monsters 
should look to it that he himself does not become a monster."* Nietzsche 
expressed deep caution toward intensive inner engagement. However, from the 
viewpoint of meditation, seeing a monster in the mirror is simply the ego’s 
perception when confronted with its own existential darkness and nihilism.



A mirror is a perfect
[
metaphor for consciousness.](/consciousness/between-nothing-and-something#The_living_Mirror_of_Emptiness_) Consider a mirror reflecting the objects placed 
before it: this illustrates the default mode of human consciousness, through 
which we perceive and become aware of the external world. Now imagine a mirror 
positioned directly opposite another mirror, creating a simple recursive loop. 
In this initial state of awakening, we experience our first fall from innocent, 
paradisiacal grace—the shock of shameful self-awareness, as we face the 
ego-monster we ourselves have become. Finally, envision two mirrors infinitely 
reflecting each other, forming an endless regression. Here, the shores of 
paradise reappear in a transformed state, where egos and monsters dissolve into 
a glorious void.

When the Void Spirals into the Void

**Meister Eckhart states:


'When the spirit turns from all 
things**
becoming into the not-becoming....



Then the void shines into void.'


Although Meister Eckhart rarely employs the 
explicit term "consciousness," he beautifully captures this phenomenon with the 
metaphor of "void shining into void." He further illustrates this intimate 
reflexivity by stating:


*'What the eye through which I see God is the 
same eye

through which God sees me.'*


The Meister does not perceive monsters in the 
mirror; he sees God.



In this chapter, we adopt a broad, intuitive, and philosophical perspective to 
more deeply explore this qualitatively distinct state. The transformative 
phenomenon discussed here occurs when consciousness transcends its initial two 
stages—awareness of external things and basic self-awareness—to enter an 
advanced state of heightened self-referential perception. At this profound 
level, consciousness becomes aware of being aware of its own awareness, 
endlessly cycling through a self-amplifying feedback loop. In this process 
conscousness discovers infinity.

THE OUROBOROS 
SNAKE

**The illustration below depicts *
[Quetzalcoatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcōātl),* 
the spiraling, self-devouring snake-god of the Aztecs.




![](/images/ouroborosAtzek.jpg)


This Aztec deity holds profound meanings deeply 
embedded within its cultural context, perhaps more distant from our own culture 
than anything imaginable. Nevertheless, there appear to be universal themes that 
resonate across diverse traditions, bridging gaps of time and geography. The 
Ouroboros—the serpent biting its own tail is not an Aztecian invention. It is one of humanity's oldest and most 
universally recognized symbols.
[Carl Gustav Jung](http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jung) 
interpreted it as an [archetypal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype) 

[
mandala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala), 
representing wholeness and infinity. **



Inspired by this ancient symbol, I will henceforth 
refer to the self-reflective feedback infinity-state of consciousness as *'[Ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros)'*. 
By uniting opposite poles in a single unbroken ring, the Ouroboros suggests that 
our awareness can similarly curve back upon itself. The self becomes both 
observer and observed, creating an intensified state of perception. Rather than 
moving in a neat straight line, consciousness begins to spiral inward, 
indefinitely looping through its own act of knowing.


The 'Kundalini' - The Indian Ouroboros

**This cyclical understanding of time resonates with ancient Indian 
philosophy, mirroring the continuous interplay between Brahma's creation, 
Shiva's destruction, and Vishnu's careful preservation of balance. The 
illustration below reflects this symbolism within Indian yogic practice. Here, the 
Ouroboros manifests as the *'[kundalini serpent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini)*,' 
lying dormant and coiled at the base of the spine until awakened through the 
yogic introspection of consciously directed awareness. To Indians, Kundalini 
represents the primal life force inherent in humanity. Typically latent within 
an individual, this energy becomes activated through the heat generated by yogic 
practices, much like a reptile stirring to life with the morning's first rays of 
sunlight.



![](/images/kundalinisnake2.jpg)


Expressed in terms of ouroboros, the awakening 
kundalini 
serpent consumes itself, initiating a self-sustaining loop of profound inner 
transformation. This state transcends conventional linear perception, existing 
without an identifiable beginning or end, thereby embodying an infinite and 
paradoxical cycle. **


Furthermore, the serpent imagery discussed here highlights the energetic 
dimension inherent in this loop. The yogi depicted sitting amidst flames 
symbolizes the intense energy necessary for spiritual transformation. In this 
context, the serpent represents the reawakening of humanity’s primal 
bio-energetic systems, as explored in the chapter '[Consiousnes 
& Evolution](/consciousness/consciousness-and-evolution).' The 
reptilian imagery powerfully conveys the immense autonomous and archaic force 
that drives this transformative process.

From Cycle to Spiral

**There are many take aways on multiple levels embedded in the self-referentiality 
in this snake symbol. Let us unfold these with an offset in T.S. Eliot's 
profound lines:


'We shall not cease from 
exploration, **
and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive

where we started and know the place for the first time.'


At its core, the Ouroboros is far more than a 
serpent devouring its own tail—it is a timeless emblem of cyclical existence, 
regeneration, and self-reflection. The symbol vividly captures how endings and 
beginnings fold into one another, hinting that every conclusion simultaneously 
seeds a new start. In this sense, life and death, creation and destruction, 
perpetually feed into each other in a self-sustaining loop. This mirrors T.S. 
Eliot’s notion of returning to our point of origin to see it, at last, with 
fresh eyes. 


From Cycle to Spiral

**For ancient Eastern cultures, the snake chasing its own tail formed a wheel, 
reminiscent of the Buddhist Wheel of Dharma. The cyclical Indian ages—such as 
the Sattva and Kali Yugas—repeated themselves endlessly, and the Persian Phoenix 
continually rose from its own ashes, not reborn as something new but as a 
replica of itself. The Egyptian afterworld was a continuation of the fertile 
river-based life they lived before death. **
In contrast, within the increasingly restless and dynamic 
context of the Western worldview, the self-devouring snake assumed the form of a 
spiral, ascending or descending. Incidentally, this sense of dynamism in Western 
thought was partly inherited from Middle Eastern Sufism, though we shall leave 
that trail unexplored for now. In this spiral-shaped reality, as C.G. Jung 
emphasizes, we encounter our internal challenges externally, as manifestations 
of destiny, until we overcome them through the process he called *
[individuation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation)* 
Each cycle reveals new layers of understanding, echoing Eliot’s insight that 
true exploration inevitably leads us home—but home itself is newly discovered in 
the process.


Thus, humanity transforms life's eternal cyclical repetition into a spiral 
pathway toward knowledge and enlightenment. Here, we become something genuinely 
new each time we symbolically die and are reborn. In fact, this is simply what 
happens everytime we learn from mistakes instead of repeating them.


Mester Eckhart's Spiritual Autophagy****
While Meister Eckhart does not directly employ 
snake imagery, meaningful connections between Western and Eastern mystical 
traditions inevitably arise. Such parallels anchor my continuous exploration and 
quest for spiritual unity.


The Ouroboros state of consciousness emerges when 
the serpent begins to feed upon itself, symbolizing a form of mental 
*
[autophagy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy)*. 
As Meister Eckhart eloquently puts it, man, in his search for god, becomes his 
own meal: 


*'What food has he prepared for 
this feast?

Himself, no less than himself, says Meister Eckhart.'*


Meister Eckhart’s concept of spiritual 
autophagy—where the soul metaphorically consumes itself—beautifully captures the 
essence of a self-referential feedback loop. In meditation, consciousness 
similarly directs its awareness inward, feeding upon its own sensory or 
perceptual signals. Just as Eckhart’s soul finds sustenance within itself, 
meditative awareness intensifies through looping back into its own perception, 
continuously amplifying self-awareness into deeper spiritual insight.




Here the soul is engaging in self-reflection to 
the extent that it becomes its own nourishment. In meditation we enter a self 
referential state where we to a lesser degree are dependent on outer stimuli. 
Instead we get high on our own supply.

As the Meister puts it: *'The moral is that those who live the life of 
the five senses never taste this 
food.'*




When consciousness turns inward, *'away from all 
things,'* it engages through the senses in a sustained, self-reflective loop, feeding on its 
own signal, enabling a 
profoundly deeper endless mirroring of itself. This conscious loop, in which *
'the void shines into void,' *has the potential to initiate an 
exponential and infinite expansion. As illustrated below, when an 
observer—represented metaphorically by a camera—is redirected from external 
objects toward itself, it activates an infinite feedback loop.

****HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS IN A REENFORCED FEED BACK LOOP

**It gives meaning to read the 
following quote from
William Blake as a sense feed back happening only when our five 
doors of perception are 'cleansed' in such a way that the feed 
back enables an infinity function:



*"If the doors of 
perception were cleansed, **
everything would appear to man as it is: infinite."

*William Blake




In this context I suggest to 
understand Blake's notion of 'cleaning' as a process where the sense apparatus 
is transformed from its ordinary 'dull' state into its original state of 
vigilent wonder in which we experienced the world as children.



Let me now summarize, through 
deliberate spiralled redundancy, what mystics—from ancient India through Meister 
Eckhart to William Blake—symbolically and poetically convey: within the 
intricate structure of the human brain lies a dormant potential for profound 
sensory self-referentiality. Normally, sensory experiences don't directly 
perceive themselves, yet in deep meditation or psychedelic states, this 
radically shifts, activating an intensified feedback loop.




Just as '*[a 
rose is a rose is a rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_is_a_rose_is_a_rose_is_a_rose),*' in these self-reflective states, our sense of 
smell can become aware of itself, our feelings can directly experience their own 
essence, taste can savor its own intrinsic quality, sounds can in the form of 
thoughts reverberate as 
echoes within the mind, and sight, as illustrated above, can gaze back upon 
itself. Moreover, this heightened state can even facilitate self-referential 
interactions between senses, giving rise to
[synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia)—where smells 
can be heard, or light can be tasted. 


The Synaptic Dance of the Ouroboros

**In the context of neurochemistry, the ancient symbol of Ouroboros, the 
serpent eating its own tail, represents the continuous feedback loop of 
signaling chemicals in the brain. When we meditate, we can experience a range of 
feelings from relaxation to ecstasy, which can be explained by the feed back 
activation of the brain's signaling chemical circuits. In this sense, life's 
purpose could be seen as the pursuit of a cocktail bar of signaling substances, 
each with its own unique effect, such as serotonin, dopamine, GABA, 
acetycholine, DMT, and many others. With up to 200 different chemical 
neurotransmitters keeping the party of life going, the possibilities are 
endless.

**Light 
and Sound****

**Drawing from the
[Radhasoami](https://rssb.org/2023-07-11.html) movement's philosophy, 
we will begin by exploring sound and light as transformative mediums for 
self-amplifying spiritual feedback mechanisms. Here, we are not referring to 
external sensory inputs but to deliberately cultivated inner 
experiences—perceptual phenomena or 'hallucinations'—that reside within the 
subjective realms of consciousness.




**AUDITORY FEEDBACK: The Human Sensory PA 
System****
An illustrative example of introverted attention within a singular auditive 
based feedback loop 
can be likened to a microphone connected to an amplifier and pointed back at 
itself. While the brain of course is far more complex as a simple sound system 
setup, the analogy stil holds as a strong pointer towards the phenomenon of 
Ouroboic feedback.



Typically, when a microphone captures external sounds—such as a singer’s 
voice—the system functions as intended. However, if a sensitive microphone is 
placed too close to the speaker it’s connected to, a loud, explosive feedback 
howl emerges.


In the video below you can se how such a feed back 
actually works and how stage engeneers are setting it up to prevent it:








Unlike the nearly instantaneous feedback of electronic 
amplification systems, the human nervous system experiences a longer latency. To 
mimic this human sensory delay, I created the sound loop below in a [Digital 
Audio Workstation (DAW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_One_(software)), incorporating approximately one second of delay.

[
feedback-generated sound loop.](http://www.meditation.dk/music/ekspfeedback.wma)*


Creating a feedback loop between a microphone and 
speaker requires three key components that mirror a meditative feedback loop:



Microphone Placement

**The microphone must be positioned near or pointed toward the speaker. In the 
same way, we need to draw closer to ourselves, directing our attention inward 
and shutting out external distractions.**


Input Sensitivity

**The amplifier’s input sensitivity must be turned up. Similarly, our senses 
should be heightened and attuned. Achieving this deeper inner sensitivity 
requires intimate and vulnerable honesty with ourselves.**



Output Volume

**Turning up the amplifier’s output volume can lead to a feedback loop. This 
higher power output parallels the energetic capacity of a strong, healthy 
individual. When we have surplus physical energy—an abundance of actively firing 
neurons—we may experience various states of flow, even during external 
activities like running or dancing.**


Within this spectrum, there are essentially two meditative extremes: one pole 
includes sensitive, introverted individuals, and the other consists of those 
with abundant, outgoing energy. The singularity of sound feeding back into its 
own output radically alters the normal function of the system. As a form of 
sensory bio-feedback, we operate in a manner similar to this self-oscillation 
process.



In fact, a professional PA system is engineered to avoid feedback. Even 
professional stage microphones are designed with a certain dullness to subtler, 
weaker sounds, preventing feedback at its source.



Evolution has likely built a similar preventive mechanism into our senses, 
keeping us from lapsing into a “stand and stare” mode when we need to remain 
active—for example, while hunting for calories.




A microphone-PA feedback loop can be damaging to the ears. It is most likely the 
latency that enables the human nervous system to handle such feedback, making it 
less disruptive. Even so, a spiritual feedback—often referred to as a kundalini 
awakening—can still be overwhelming and in rare cases even damaging. It is no 
childs play for conscious awareness to go into feed back with itself through the 
human brain.



In this way, meditation can be likened to conscious awareness listening to 
itself. Now, what happens when consciousness is seeing itself?


Thoughts as Sounds

**Even the thinking mind can be guided into a self-referential 
loop. Repetition of a mantra—whether silently or aloud—engages 
the meditator in sound-based meditation. Fundamentally, thoughts 
are auditory phenomena. They are soundwaves assigned with meaning. In continuous 
repetition, the cognitive meaning within thoughts fades, leaving 
only the pure sound itself. Techniques such as the initial inquiry of *
["Who am I?"](Who_am_I.htm)* 
similarly leverage thought-based meditation practices to 
dissolve cognitive structures. According to the wise ancient 
Indians creation at its core is the eternal hum of 'OM'.**


VISUAL FEEDBACK****

**A similar feedback loop can be observed when a camera is pointing at itself through a monitor screen.





![](/images/fraktalmedi.jpg)


A similar feedback loop occurs when a camera is 
pointed at its own monitor screen. In the video clip below, you can see a 
dynamic version of an accelerating, introspective loop created simply by aiming 
a handheld camera at the TV to which it’s connected. The fractal, kaleidoscopic 
patterns arise because the camera continuously amplifies its own signal. Tiny 
camera movements cause unpredictable, ever-shifting visuals, all moving toward 
a fractal infinity function.






Isn't it intriguing how a simple act—pointing a 
camera at itself—can produce such surprising and intricate phenomena? As 
demonstrated in the video, the visual feedback can strikingly resemble 
experiences people describe under the influence of psychedelics. While many 
online explanations attribute these effects to factors such as the pineal gland, 
I suggest a simpler interpretation, guided by Occam’s razor: psychedelic 
substances relax or remove the brain's typical sensory filters, allowing all 
incoming signals, now amplified and unfiltered, to flood consciousness. This 
generates a distinct feedback loop. In the image below, you can clearly see the 
remarkable similarity between the Buddha generated through video feedback and 
traditional Himalayan sculptural depictions:

THE SKIN: Self-Referential Amplification 
Through Sensation

**Mirrors and microphones provide illustrative metaphors for 
feedback loops involving light and sound, but the human body offers an even more 
fundamental form: feedback loops of bodily sensations.**


In meditation, primal awareness of internal sensations—such as subtle bodily 
feelings, emotions, and textures—is often the earliest sensory channel activated 
during introspection. Yet paradoxically, this realm of close-range sensation 
tends to be overlooked in meditation practices. Typically, meditators focus on 
visual experiences (inner imagery or "light") or auditory sensations (inner 
sounds or mantras). In contrast, bodily sensing remains largely unconscious, 
partly because it's the oldest evolutionary sense, thus deeply ingrained and 
difficult for conscious awareness to penetrate. In essence, we exist as bundles 
of unconsciously roaring sensations, often without clear awareness of their 
presence. Let's explore this overlooked dimension more deeply.



When you close your eyes and direct attention inward, an immediate and automatic
[increase of abstract bodily awareness 
occurs](/fields/meditative-pixelation). These sensations range from subtle external sensations of the skin 
to inner sensations such as feelings and emotions. Amplifying these bodily 
sensations represents the essential, primordial step into a meditative 
self-referential space.



Introspective, close-range self-awareness begins precisely with carefully 
observing bodily sensations, initiating feedback loops at the most basic sensory 
level. Consciousness, by directing attention inward, creates a self-amplifying 
cycle in which sensation feeds back into awareness, further intensifying 
perception. Simply observing initiates this loop because our life force 
naturally follows our attention—illustrated by the Eastern saying, *"Where 
attention goes, prana flows."* This foundational process demonstrates how 
subtle bodily sensations can catalyze profound states of meditative 
self-awareness.




An [Indian Master of Meditation](old_meditation_master.htm) in Hoshiarpur in 1995 shared with 
me that his groundbreaking enlightenment experience began with a 
simple itching sensation on the crown of his head. As he sat 
before an enlightened master, gazing at him, the sensation 
intensified until it completely engulfed him, causing him to 
lose all sense of time, space, and physical boundaries. 
[The Station Master](rebellious_meditation_master.htm), another 
spiritual being from another 
lineage pointed out to me the obsvious secret that, in fact, our skin sensation 
is the most fundamental, yet unconscious, foundation in meditation.


From there, it may extend through 
any or all of the five sensory pathways. Common meditative 
experiences include hearing internal sounds or seeing visual 
phenomena. Even the senses of taste and smell, though less 
frequently activated, can become prominent. For instance, Indian 
Sufis have developed meditations focused on experiencing various 
flower fragrances.


Psychedelics and sense-feedback

**Interestingly, people who use entheogenic substances often report profound 
experiences of eternity and divinity. This is because these substances increase 
the sensitivity of the brain's five input circuits, resulting in an explosion of 
a multitude of self-referential feedback loops. The similarities between 
meditative and psychedelic experiences is rooted in the world of feedback 
interfaces. In both cases, sensory impressions are intensified to the point that 
a singular feedback loop is inevitable, leading to visions and experiences 
beyond the ordinary. 


**THE *GREAT ATTRACTOR*: The Black Hole in the Soul

**What have we discovered so far? When consciousness, in a reinforced loop, 
begins to chase its own tail, wakefulness intensifies dramatically. This 
extraordinary event, to my knowledge, uniquely unfolds within the human brain. 
It signifies the emergence of Ouroboros consciousness in the form of 
consciousness knowing knowing. Like consciousness 
itself, this phenomenon defies conventional scientific frameworks, refusing to 
be confined neatly within a Cochrane test tube, yet beautifully revealing itself 
through a poem crafted by Occam's Razor dipped in ink.**



Einstein once remarked that the universe folds into itself. Consciousness 
similarly folds inward at a certain evolutionary stage. The cosmos is structured 
upon repeated mathematical algorithms at every scale, from infinitely small to 
infinitely vast. Although this viewpoint may not strictly adhere to scientific 
definitions, it transcends mere metaphor, deeply linking us to the quantum realm 
and the broader cosmos.



Having explored sensory self-referentiality in meditation, we now expand our 
perspective to cosmic dimensions, metaphorically capturing how consciousness 
itself is irresistibly drawn inward, mirroring the gravitational pull of the *
'Great Attractor'.*




The cosmic metaphor of the *Great Attractor* symbolizes consciousness folding 
inward because it reflects how intense self-referentiality draws awareness 
toward an internal center, much like the gravitational pull of a massive cluster 
of stars, dark matter or a black hole.




Structurally, this metaphor mirrors the central argument: consciousness, when 
turning inward upon itself, generates a self-sustaining feedback loop that 
progressively deepens awareness, ultimately transforming the individual by 
collapsing old patterns (symbolized by stars dissolving into a black hole) and 
initiating profound renewal.



Fractal imagery demonstrates consistent patterns traversing infinite expanses 
between micro and macro levels. Through fractal repetition, the smallest serpent 
bites the tail of the largest, making distinctions between small and large 
obsolete.



In this spirit, I acknowledge myself as a micro-galaxy, harboring a 
black hole at the core of my soul. This black soul-hole symbolizes both the 
precise point of death and the gateway to rebirth. Here reside my angels in 
joyous anticipation. Upon entering the intensified gravitational embrace of 
Ouroboros, I dissolve, mirroring the fate of stars irresistibly drawn into the 
Grand Attractor of Eckhart's primordial ground. Civilizations undergo similar dissolution, as does climate and 
everything else spinning within the relentless reenforced spiral of change. *The King is 
dead. Long live the King.*



This is the Work of the Great Attractor. We fear the death it brings, yet we 
cannot resist its magnetic allure. I now leave it to beloved Rumi to conclude 
this chapter with a awe-inspiring spiralling insight:


When I die, I shall soar with 
angels,

and when I die to the angels,

what I shall become, you cannot imagine.
