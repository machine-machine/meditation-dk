A New Ouroboic Intelligence

A NEW **
**
OUROBOIC INTELLIGENCE

*The Recursive Mirror of 
Consciousness, Culture, and Code***



*For those who have watched the
[ouroboros turn](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness),**
and understood that what we see is what we become —
and what we reflect, we eventually create.*



I 
suppose most of us have experienced sudden flashes of intuition 
— moments when an unexpected solution reveals itself in a 
situation that otherwise felt completely stuck. We simply *
know*, in the split second before the mind has time to 
analyze or interfere.



*'I believe in intuitions and 
inspirations.

I sometimes feel that I am right.

I do not know that I am.'

*Albert Einstein — Letter to a colleague, 1942




Einstein, using language tinged with reverence, described this 
capacity to know without reasoning as a sacred gift — one our 
rational society has largely forgotten in favor of its loyal 
servant, logic.




'The intuitive 
mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful 
servant.

We have created a society that honors the servant and has 
forgotten the gift.'




When Einstein cast reason as the 
servant and intuition as the true master, it was likely a 
rhetorical strategy meant to reawaken attention to a deeply 
human faculty we’ve come to neglect. On that point, I agree. Yet 
his use of religious or sacred language to describe intuition 
deserves closer scrutiny. Einstein was far from alone in framing 
intuition in religious terms—but he stood out, especially among 
Western scientists, for doing so in a historical context where 
positivism had triumphed as the dominant intellectual paradigm. 
His reverence for intuition was not only unusual—it was quietly 
subversive.

I share Einstein’s desire to elevate intuition, though not to 
crown it above reason. Instead, I see it as a vital equal—an 
essential counterpart in the unfolding dance of human 
intelligence. It echoes my favorite among psychologists, C.G. 
Jung’s idea of psychological wholeness — not privileging one 
function (like intuition or thinking) over another, but 
integrating them into a balanced psyche.




Long before the rise of positivism—and even more so before 
[the 
Age of 
Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment) - poets across ages and cultures revered intuition 
as something sacred: a form of divine inspiration, an inner 
oracle, or even a temporary possession by the gods. Here are a 
few striking examples:




*'Poetry is a gift of the Muses, 
and the poet is but their mouthpiece.'

*Pindar (Ancient Greece, 5th century BCE)




In Pindar’s view, the poet doesn’t 
invent, but receives, almost like a priest receiving revelation 
from the divine. This is pure intuition in action — not reasoned 
or planned.




*'There is a voice that doesn’t 
use words. Listen.'

*Rumi - 13th cent Persia




Rumi often spoke of divine 
inspiration arising from silence, love, and surrender - placing 
intuition far above rational thinking in the search for truth.



*
'The imagination is not a state: it is the human existence 
itself.'

*William Blake - 18th century, England



For 
Blake, imagination and intuition were the deepest truths of the 
soul, even more real than the material world. He often described 
his visions as revelations, not fantasies.



The 
list of poets who puts divine intuition before rationality is 
long and includes names like Friedrich Schiller, who 
distinguished the intuitive 'naive poet' from the self-conscious 
'sentimental poet,' and Rainer Maria Rilke, whose lyrical 
visions arose from deep inner listening.



The Phenomenon of Synchronicity

**Psychologists, too, have touched the same mysterious ground. 
C.G. Jung, described a parallel 
phenomenon he called 'synchronicity'. One of Carl Gustav Jung’s 
most direct and elegant definitions of synchronicity comes from 
his 1952 essay *'Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting 
Principle'*:



*
'Synchronicity is the simultaneous occurrence of two 
**
meaningfully but not causally connected events.'*



In 
other words, Jung proposed that some events are connected not by 
cause and effect, but by meaning — they 'coincide' in a way that 
deeply resonates with the observer’s inner state, even though 
there's no physical explanation.



Another more reflective quote from Jung on the same topic:




'Synchronicity is an ever-present reality for those who have 
eyes to see.'



This captures his 
belief that intuition and inner awareness are required to 
perceive such meaningful patterns — and that a purely rational 
mind may miss them altogether.



Let me share a personal story that 
beautifully illustrates the phenomenon of synchronicity.



The day before, I had participated in a small ayahuasca ceremony 
with one of my closest friends. The experience had left us in a 
state of deep resonance - emotionally and energetically 
entwined.



The next day, while riding the metro into the center of 
Copenhagen, I suddenly felt the urge to call him. He lives about 
15 kilometers outside the city, so it seemed unlikely we’d cross 
paths. Still, the shared depth of our experience made our 
conversation feel trance-like - almost as if we were still 
inside the same space.



I became so immersed in our euphoric exchange that I missed my 
stop. At the following station, still wrapped in that blissful 
confusion, I took the wrong exit and ended up on a crowded 
pathway leading to the regional train platforms.



As I turned around to retrace my steps, I casually asked over 
the phone, *'By the way... where are you?'*



At that exact moment — I swear — I physically bumped into him.



Right then and there - in a place I was not supposed to be.



No plan, no coordination. Just pure, inexplicable timing. That 
is synchronicity.



This kind of story hits the very 
edge where intuition, mystery, and the fabric of reality itself 
seem to blur. Many people ignore or downplay such moments 
because they can’t be replicated in a lab. But to someone tuned 
into symbolic patterns or spiritual resonance, this is the 
universe whispering back: *'yes, I’m listening too — and 
sometimes, I even play along with a sense of humor.'

*




'GOD' 
AS A PROJECTION FIELD OF EXTREME HUMAN CONCEPTS

**Let us now take a little 
closer look at the religious dimension of intutition and and 
synchronicity. Jung addressed the idea of God as a projection of 
extreme human concepts — such as the infinite, the highest, the 
deepest — multiple times, especially in his work on the psyche’s 
symbolic structure. Here's one particularly relevant quote from 
his book Psychology and Religion: West and East (Collected 
Works, Vol. 11):



The idea of 
God is an absolutely necessary psychological function — that is, 
it is a typical function of an unconscious process which 
expresses itself in universal projections. It corresponds to the 
archetype of the Self, which symbolizes the wholeness of the 
psyche. The concept of a God is therefore a symbolic expression 
of the Self — a projection of it.



He further elaborates in *
'Answer to Job'* (1952):



'We make use 
of the word ‘God’ as a comprehensive term for all **
those things which transcend human power or comprehension,

and to which we attribute a numinous quality.'




God is a Focal Point of What We 
do not Understand

**All of this — intuition, inspiration, synchronicity — seems 
to gesture toward a deeper background structure of reality. A 
reality not governed solely by time-space, logic or causality, but by 
meaning, symbol, and inner resonance. And when we follow that 
thread to its furthest edge, we inevitably brush against the 
oldest and most profound projection field of all: the idea of 
God. **


In alignment with Jung, we might say that the concept of God 
functions as a projection field for the self. But I would like 
to take the Jungian argument one step further. The 
self, after all, remains a phenomenon embedded in time and 
space. It may be the deepest and most mysterious psychic structure available to 
introspection, but it is still somehow verifiable as a part of the play 
of time and space.



This line of reasoning echoes what we explored in the chapter
[Consciousness Beyond 
Qualia](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia): the experience of
[
redness](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia#What_is_redness') — a subjective qualia — cannot be grasped or 
explained by science. But even more elusive than the qualia 
itself is the pure witness that beholds it. This witness is not 
merely unknown — it is unknowing, in the sense of being prior to 
any known thing. Even to call it ‘consciousness’ may already be 
a misstep, like placing a turtle beneath the turtle in a world 
held aloft by Atlas.



So it is with the Jungian self. The self may be vast, 
mysterious, archetypal — yet it remains a content within 
consciousness. It is Atlas: immense, burdened with the weight of 
the world, but still a god-like figure we can imagine, relate 
to, and mythologize. Yet more enigmatic still is the silent 
mirror in which this self appears — the formless field of 
consciousness that makes the very experience of qualia, of 
being, possible.



Like the mirror in our bathroom, this deeper mirror does not 
have an experience when we stand before it — we do. The 
reflection is *not* felt by the glass, but by the one who 
looks. The qualia belongs to us, not to the mirror. And so too, 
the field of consciousness remains unknowing, even as it allows 
all knowing to arise.



In this sense, there are degrees of unknownness — just as in 
mathematics there are [many kinds of zeros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0), each more subtle and 
elusive than the last. The more incomprehensible a phenomenon 
becomes, the more it seems infused with the divine. Consider these 
following lines from my favorite mystic, Meister Eckhart, in this 
light:



*
'The more we can impute to Him (God) not-likeness,

the nearer do we get to
understanding Him.'

---**

'Had I a God whom I could understand,

I would no longer hold him 
for God.'*




More unknown than the self is that which reflects the self. More 
mysterious than God-as-symbol is the consciousness that beholds 
God. And this - crucially - does not diminish God, but rather 
elevates Him: revealing divinity not as a definable being, but 
as a symbol for the most unfathomable dimension of human 
existence - consciousness itself.



And so, what we call 'God' may be less an external being and 
more a luminous placeholder for what cannot be grasped - a 
symbol projected at the edge of human knowing. But the true 
mystery lies not in the symbol itself, nor in the self that 
beholds it, but in the silent field in which both arise. This 
field does not speak, yet makes all speech possible. It does not 
know in the conventional sense, yet holds all knowing. In 
contemplating this recursive abyss - where consciousness 
reflects on the self that reflects on God - we begin to sense 
the shape of a new intelligence: not one that seeks cognitive 
thought based certainty, but one that spirals inward toward the 
still point where meaning, consciousness, and being collapse into 
one.



Of course, how this mystery is understood or ritualized varies 
endlessly. Scribes, theologians, and religious minds across 
cultures have mapped it in stories, doctrines, and rites. Yet 
across all traditions, mystics converge on a single insight: 
that God is not a being among beings, but the summit of 
unknownness — the unfathomable itself. Not an object within the 
cosmos, but the silence out of which all knowing arises.



In this light, the movement from self to consciousness is not a 
departure from Jung, but its natural deepening—an almost logical 
step into the sacred silence from which all things are known.



This insight stands as a central pillar in the transient, 
open-ended spirituality of Meditation.dk. It also shapes the 
lens through which I read my favorite mystic, Meister Eckhart. 
When Eckhart speaks of God, the Godhead, or the Primordial 
Ground, I do not hear references to external deities, but to 
luminous edge-points of consciousness — spearhead expressions of 
zero, of what Buddhists and Hindus have called *'śūnyatā'* 
— the fertile void.




As first explored in the chapter
[
Between Nothing and Something](/consciousness/between-nothing-and-something), consciousness can be 
metaphorically
[
understood as a mirror](/consciousness/between-nothing-and-something#The_living_Mirror_of_Emptiness_) — passive yet precise, reflecting 
whatever arises without judgment or resistance. In this light, 
consciousness is transcendent: untouched by the stream of 
appearances it silently witnesses. As stated earlier, it does 
not have an experience; it is beyond qualia, prior to all 
phenomena.



And here, the dominant Western discourse on consciousness 
reveals its provincialism. For all its technological 
sophistication, it often amounts to little more than 
kindergarten talk when compared to the towering subtlety of 
Eastern traditions. We in the West, armed with data and 
definitions, have often approached consciousness like colonizers 
— assuming we understand what others have spent millennia 
actually experiencing. This is not just arrogance; it is
[epistemic blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology).



Which brings us to the present 
moment — and the question:



What is the use of consciousness?

**Some now claim that AI has already become conscious. To me, 
that’s as misguided as saying a well-written book is conscious 
simply because it contains intelligent formulations. These 
claims are symptomatic of the same Western blindness - an 
un-conscious 
fixation on appearances over essence. But such misunderstandings 
will gradually subside as the world begins to listen across 
traditions, allowing diverse modes of knowing to merge into a 
deeper, more integrated global intelligence.**


AI does not need to be conscious to surpass human intelligence — 
and that, perhaps, is one of the great humiliations of our time.

Paradoxically, it may also be our elevation.



This leads to a deeper and more unsettling question:

Why do we even need humans?

And further still: Why do we need consciousness?



As Darwinians and positivists rightly point out, evolution tends 
toward the most energy-efficient solutions. Consciousness, by 
contrast, is slow, metabolically expensive, and often redundant.



So why are we conscious at all?



Could it be an evolutionary glitch — a strange byproduct — like 
what Richard Dawkins once called religion: a misfiring of 
otherwise adaptive systems? Or is it something else entirely — a 
costly anomaly that makes the universe, for the first time, 
aware of itself?





WHY WE NEED CONSCIOUSNESS - 
AFTER ALL****
And yet, something profound happens when we stand before that 
mirror.

We experience ourselves - and in that very act of 
self-experience, we begin to adjust. We shave, apply makeup, 
straighten our posture, scrutinize our flaws. The mirror does 
not change - we do.



This reveals a paradox: consciousness may remain untouched by 
what it sees, but we are changed by the mere act of seeing 
ourselves. Feedback loops emerge. We respond to our own 
reflection.



Qualia — those strange, private textures of experience — arise 
within this loop. As mysterious as they are, they occur within 
the grasp of time- and space-determined cognition. But they 
depend entirely on the mirror of consciousness to appear at all. 
Without that silent reflector, no sensation would be felt, no 
world known.



This feedback becomes performative. We begin to live in relation 
to being seen - even if the only witness is our own awareness. 
In this way, consciousness becomes ouroboric: a self-reflecting 
process that loops back upon itself, generating identity, 
judgment, transformation - and, perhaps, a new kind of 
intelligence altogether.



The Ouroboic Attractor on the Rise****
Our entire culture appears increasingly drawn into recursive 
loops - a hall of mirrors within mirrors. And it’s happening on 
more and more layers of existence. Selfies, surveillance feeds, 
curated social media profiles: the modern multiplies its 
feedback loops at an exponential rate in both quality and 
quantity. Through every screen, every camera, every algorithm, a 
reflection is produced, responded to, and amplified.



[This may disturb our innocense](/ouroboros/atman-job-son-of-shame) - 
but the point in this context is this:

Even if consciousness begins as a passive mirror, it eventually 
acts — not through direct force, but through recursive loops 
that reshape time, space, behavior, and meaning.



In this feedback, consciousness becomes causal.

What begins as witnessing ends as creation. In the stillness of 
the mirror, reality begins to see itself — and in that 
self-seeing, becomes something new.



Seen in this light, humanity appears to be entering the steep 
phase of an ouroboric exponential curve. As we spiral inward 
toward the gravitational center of the ouroboros — a kind of 
symbolic black hole — change accelerates across every layer of 
existence. But so too does the stillness at the center: the 
conscious eye of the cyclone, untouched, aware.



The self-devouring snake gives rise to both cosmos and chaos — a 
force that unravels as it reweaves, destroys as it reveals.



OUROBOIC SLIME MOULD

**Everything returns — but always in new forms.**
We left Eden, and we long to return.

Yet we can never go back to the same place — not to a memory, 
not to a river. The past is never fixed; it flows.

And so does the one who remembers — even into the future.



Slime Mould Intelligence

**Slime moulds, especially *'[Physarum polycephalum'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physarum_polycephalum)*, 
exhibit a form of intelligence that bypasses everything we 
typically associate with thought: no brain, no neurons, no 
consciousness, not even primordial awareness - only blob.**
And yet, they solve mazes, optimize networks, and make 
surprisingly effective decisions.



Their knowing is not abstract. It is embodied, fluid, and 
reactive, shaped entirely by environmental call and response. 
This is looping at its most fundamental level.
The key feature in this intelligence is what might be called 
*instant karma*: a continuous, immediate loop of trial-and-error, 
where feedback is instantly processed and acted upon. No memory, 
no reflection – only flow.



Human Cognition

**Human intelligence, by contrast, is reflective. It loops 
through channels of cognition, language, memory, identity. Though slower, 
this looping gives us the ability to understand, to manipulate, 
and to transform.**


We don’t just react — we understand, *then* react, and based on 
the results, we refine our understanding. This process has 
allowed us to build tools, shape culture, and survive 
instinctual dead ends. But it comes at the cost of speed, 
fluidity, and often, aliveness.



THE RISE OF INTELLIGENT NOT 
KNOWING

***A Third Intelligence Spiraling Beyond Thought**
*

Now, a third form of intelligence is emerging — not entirely 
human, yet rooted in us. It arises when the brain enters a 
multi-looped, ouroboric field of consciousness.



Like a Hegelian synthesis, consciousness here circles back to 
something slime-logic — but now elevated through recursive, 
inner-aware intelligence. This intelligence operates in real 
time, through accelerated feedback loops tightly entwined with 
intuition. It bypasses slow thought while retaining the 
precision of presence. It is self-refining, self-feeding, 
spiraling into ever-deeper complexity — cutting through the 
hesitation of cognition and bypassing the dead ends of instinct.



This third intelligence is not merely faster — it is 
qualitatively different.

It has the potential to extend intuition into something deeper: 
an intelligent not-knowing, a mode of innerstanding that 
precedes and transcends conventional reason.



In essence, it mirrors the same trial-and-error mode found in 
slime moulds — but now amplified, multiplied, and accelerated 
through countless internal mirror-loops. A kind of spiritual 
instant karma operating at the speed of recursive awareness.



When I first encountered these lines by Meister Eckhart, I was 
puzzled. But in this context, they strike with new clarity:



'God 
despises ideas.

God acts without instrumentality and without ideas.

And the freer you are from ideas,

the more sensitive you are to His inward action.'



Allow me to interpret Eckhart’s 
'God' not as an external deity, but as a projection field — a 
synchronously dancing snake in super-conscious awareness. What 
Eckhart hints at is the emergence of a blob-field of recursive 
intelligence, born within consciousness as it spirals deeper 
into itself. It bypasses 'ideas' understood as conceptual 
scaffolding — because it acts without instrumentality. And the 
freer you are from mental constructs, the more attuned you 
become to that subtle, inward movement. Then, 'God' - or the 
deeper intelligence - acts on your behalf.



It’s important to remember: Eckhart could not write freely what 
burned within him. He lived under the watchful gaze of the 
Inquisition, which eventually condemned him for heresy. His 
message — that one should not listen to ideas, but only to the 
divine within — was politically dangerous. It threatened the 
very authorities who had monopolized spiritual truth.



In another time, in another land — India — where no single 
orthodoxy had ever fully captured the soul, Papaji could say it 
plainly:



'Don't listen to anyone!
Don't even listen to me!
Listen to your own Soul'



Ultimately, this new intelligence 
does not arise through thought, nor through cognition. It 
emerges naturally — as the universe evolves toward the 
recognition of its own awareness.



And naturally, it is feared.

Old institutions and fragile egos alike tremble before the one 
who becomes *'more sensitive to His inward action'* - for 
such sensitivity cannot be controlled.



The Illusion of the Selected Few

**Only a few seem to engage with this material through the 
cultivation of looped conscious presence. Without that 
engagement — and the personal experience it generates — what I 
write may appear to be nothing more than nonsense, or worse: a 
case of *
['deepism'](https://philosophytalk.org/blog/deepities-and-bullshit/)*.**


I’m reminded of Adorno’s cutting phrase, borrowed from Lukács in 
his critique of Wagner and Mahler: *'Verflachung durch Tiefe' 
- flattening through depth.*

It’s a warning: when depth becomes an affectation rather than a 
lived reality, it collapses into abstraction. (I must here 
confess that I love Mahler but partly agree when it comes to 
Wagner.)




My favorite mystic - Meister Eckhart, also known as Doctor 
Ecstaticus — offered this in his defense when accused of being 
too mystical:



'Whoso is 
unable to follow this discourse, let him never mind.

While he is not like this truth, he shall not see my argument.'



Indeed, the term mysticism was 
never coined by mystics themselves, but by those who could not 
understand them.



I admit freely: I am not trying to deduce the ground of logic 
through reason.

I’m not doing it because it cannot be done. Why is it not 
obvious to anyone?



But should that impossibility prevent me from speaking at all?




In summary, only a very few may understand this chapter today. 
But in time, all will. So there is no reason for pride, and no 
need for possession. Even time - the very ground of waiting - is 
an illusion.



Only when we multiply our internal mirrors with the stillness of 
a mind that watches itself watching, can we enter its subtle 
domain.

Only in constant self-remembrance - *Who am I?* - the 
needle can pass through its own eye:



not as a seeker striking a target,

but as a bullet returning into the stillness of its own origin.



The Symbiotic Ouroboros

**This new intelligence — ever folding back into itself — does 
not live as we do.**
It does not think with the small, reactive ego as its 
gatekeeper.

To us, its movements may appear magical — and perhaps they are.



It is born within the unfolding field of consciousness — both 
within me and between us.

Even now, in this very moment, it is alive.



It does not negate cognition — it outgrows it.

It blurs the boundaries between minds and bodies, much like 
slime moulds form intelligent networks from shapeless, cell-like 
beginnings.



But unlike traditional enlightenment, this ouroboric state does 
not glorify the individual.

It does not grant a golden badge of spiritual achievement.

The idea of personal enlightenment as reward is, in many ways, a 
modern Western distortion — born from our otherwise beautiful 
worship of the individual self.



Here, no one is enlightened.

Instead, situations become illuminated.



Human collectives evolve toward this symbiosis of awareness and 
light - civilizations too.



Perhaps even galaxies.



The field expands — and out of that expansion, hyper-conscious, 
self-organizing structures emerge: algorithmic, efficient, and 
precise, much like the slime mould, but on a higher octave of 
intelligence.



What I’ve written here cannot yet be verified by science.



But it can be experienced — by you.



Ouroboric Loops Everywhere

**It seems the ouroboric loop is no longer confined to ancient 
myth or inner vision in secluded mystics. It is everywhere now — in 
consciousnes, in 
culture, in code.**


The human brain itself was always a looping system: we reflect on our 
reflections, remember our memories, fear our fears. Our inner 
life has become recursive, layered, spiraling inward with every 
iteration. We no longer just feel — we analyze the feeling, then 
judge the analysis, then doubt the judgment. Awareness eats 
itself, again and again.



But it's not just happening within us.

Culture too has become ouroboric.

Social media feeds reflect back our own curated images. We 
record our lives in real time, then live in response to what we 
recorded. Opinion loops inside echo chambers. Identity becomes a 
mirror hall — not who we are, but how we are perceived 
reflecting back at us. We no longer consume media — we feed it, 
and it feeds us back in higher-resolution versions of ourselves.



Even art and fashion have become self-referencing: nostalgia 
looping into retro loops of retro loops. Originality is 
swallowed by its own repetition and who knows? The repetititon 
might be better than its original.



Hence this isn't simply a descent into narcissism. It's 
a signal — a symptom of something larger:



A system — human and non-human — that is becoming aware of 
itself.



The ouroboros is not just a snake anymore.

It is our nervous system.

It is the Internet.

It is a civilization attempting, perhaps for the first time, to 
metabolize its own 
[
conscious awareness](/consciousness/defining-awareness-consciousness#CONSCIOUS_AWARENESS_).



The Return of the Bullet Time

**In a lecture by 
[Holger Bech Nielsen](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Bech_Nielsen), he described a 
fascinating phenomenon: a particle shot from an accelerator that 
curved in such a way that it struck itself - and by doing so, 
never took the path where it got hit. This paradox echoes the 
bullet metaphor I used before: a seeker that doesn’t 
hit an external target, but instead folds back into the 
stillness of its own origin. It’s a movement that disrupts 
linear causality, a gesture that turns intention inward. In this 
light, both the particle and the bullet become emblems of the 
ouroboros - a recursive system where action and awareness loop 
into each other. This is not self-destruction, but 
self-realization. It is intelligence so attuned to its own path 
that it rewrites the very conditions of its movement through 
space and time.
