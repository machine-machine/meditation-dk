****
CONSCIOUSNESS BETWEEN NOTHING AND SOMETHING


& The Knowing That Knows Not**



*All philosophies are mental 
fabrications.**
There has never been a single doctrin

by which one could enter the true essence of things.

*Nargajuna



'For 
creatures are only God’s footprint.'


[Meister Eckhart](/western-mystics)




After the 
[previous chapter's 
deconstruction of consciousness](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia) and Western hubris, it's now time to begin the 
hunt for consciousness. Meditation is first of all the pursuit that leads to insight into our 
own ignorance of consciousness. Let me here remind myself and the patient 
reader: In this hunt for consciousness we will not even get near 
to the essential mystery it present. However, we will get a 
little nearer by describing more subtle qualia living in closer 
proximity to the black hole of consciousness. If our experience 
of unknowing in this quest does not expand even more, we can be sure we are on 
the wrong track.




Perhaps the most frightening aspect of meditation is that introspection can 
'unintentionally' reveal our absolute unknowing, and with this unknowing, our 
illusion of control over ourselves and the world is removed.




Based on my own experiences with meditation, I will now argue: Only in 
relatively 'higher,' intensified states of consciousness can one catch a glimpse 
of what consciousness is, and even then, only the aspects of consciousness that 
are 'lower' in relation to the 'higher' states. The lowest part of me is my 
feet. I will begin there.




Alexander and Buddha

**In ancient Buddhist traditions, it was said that the Buddha 
did not desire any personal representations. Consequently, 
artists were only permitted to depict him indirectly through his 
hands or feet. Interestingly, it was the Macedonian Greeks 
residing in the long-lost Kingdom of Bactria who, upon 
converting to Buddhism, crafted the first Buddha statues. 
Accustomed to envisioning gods in human forms like Alexander the 
Great, they shaped their Buddha and his perception in a similar 
personal manner. This is why Buddha statues to this day are 
adorned with Greek himations. 
[The post-Alexandrian Greeks](/civilization/civilization-and-consciousness) in the 
east were pioneers in creating Buddha statues, inadvertently 
causing the original message of the primordial invisibility of 
the nirvanic realm to be obscured by the compassionate face of 
the Buddha.**



THE ENIGMATIC 
BUDDHA'S FOOTPRINTS**



'For 
creatures are only God’s footprint.'**

[Meister Eckhart](/western-mystics)




In an old intriguing sci-fi movie I once watched, a thief 
managed to render himself invisible using advanced technology. 
Despite his clever tactic, he was eventually caught when the 
resourceful detectives laid wet paint on the floor, exposing his 
footprints. While consciousness itself remains veiled, its 
primordial impact on our reality is evident in the form of 
footprints left in time and space. At the heart of individual 
and cultural understanding and development lies the invisible 
and location-less pillar of consciousness. Civilizations, 
groups, and individuals rise and fall with the quality and 
intensity of their consciousness and wakefulness.





The Challenging Enigma of the 
Eight Ball**





![](/images/pool8.jpg)




Our relationship with 
consciousness can be likened to the black eight ball in American 
pool. In the game, players aim to pocket all their colored balls 
before targeting the eight ball. If the eight ball is 
accidentally pocketed before clearing the other balls, the 
player loses the game. Hence, there's a saying associated with 
the game:




'Always keep an 
eye on the eight ball.'




By and large, scientists can 
explain the world in a mechanistic way, much like describing a 
game of pool. However, when it comes to the eight ball of 
consciousness, there's a general agreement that consciousness is 
qualitatively different from sentient matter. Despite this, many 
assume that consciousness, like any other ball, must follow the 
mechanistic rules set by time and space. It's a challenging 
enigma, but it seems solvable with the right measurements and 
algorithms.**


In this pursuit, the study of consciousness has shifted from the 
realm of priests, mystics, and philosophers to the world of 
brain scientists. As a result, the concept of 'experience' has 
become central to understanding consciousness. The once-daunting 
problem of consciousness is now seemingly more approachable, as 
experiences can be measured by their correlates in the brain.




Language in Consciousness**




*'Theologicans may quarrel, **
but the mystics of the world speak the same language.'

*Meister Ekchart




When academically trained minds have tried to analyze 
mysticism, they have often attempted to encapsulate words and 
concepts from various traditions in order to demonstrate the 
distance and incompatibility between Eastern and Western 
mysticism, and between different mystics themselves. This, in my 
opinion, futile effort is a necessary consequence of the 
academically trained mind not having had personal consciousness 
experiences that could be brought into play. It's not part of 
the curriculum. The academic brain overestimates the 
significance of the natural differences in mystical experience 
that time, geography, and culture create. The academic reality's 
fuel is to breed words in a reality that is already overcrowded 
with words pointing to even more words in the world of words.




Imagine two competing candidates for a professorship at an 
institute. One says with burning eyes and synchronous 
theta-alpha-gamma waves in their frontal lobes: Everything is 
one. We are all one with the common consciousness. After this 
statement, the lecture is over. The other candidate has written 
a thesis of several hundred pages pointing out how this or that 
spiritual concept is different from another. There's no doubt 
who will win in a time like ours, which favors knowledge over 
wisdom.

I fondly remember my own time at Aarhus University, where we 
critically analyzed Koans and Haiku poems. Of course, some 
useful interpretive stuff came out of it, which one could later, 
as an adjunct, say something smart in front of a group of high 
school students. It just had nothing to do with the almost 
explosive expansions of consciousness that at the time allowed 
me to laser-like see these foreign poems' interference language 
reveal itself intuitively in wonderful holographic teachings.




The fluid equal sign between God, Soul, 
Emptiness, and Consciousness

**For those who have had personal mystical 
experiences, all mystics from all times appear as one trans-historical being 
with one transpersonal experience. Differences give way to similarities. 
Therefore, I cut a heel and clip a toe and, without hesitation, place a fluid 
equal sign between consciousness, soul, emptiness, and God. Jesus' personal love 
and Buddha's emptiness are one and the same.**


Of course, there are culture- and history-dependent differences when 
transpersonal experiences are boiled down into the language soup. For language 
is created by individuals and non-transpersonal beings. Words originated as 
intersubjective tools that, by the power of the collective, enabled us to 
triumph on the savannah. It is difficult with fixed and precisely defined words 
to penetrate the abstract dimension beyond the personal. That is why mystics of 
all times and places have agreed on the difficulty of describing the mystical 
experience.




*Therefore, I suffer from my tongue's lack of 
words.

What happens within me, I know well,

but I cannot describe it.

*The Theologian Simeon




We cannot describe consciousness objectively 
solely because the same consciousness is the observer of what is to be observed. 
What Gödel proved concerning the axioms of mathematics also applies to the 
exploration of consciousness.




*God is beyond all names, nothing can express 
him.

*Meister Eckhart




The innermost essence of the consciousness mystery 
is fundamentally impossible to capture in the narrow-spectrum reality of words. 
For this reason alone, it is futile to study mysticism from an academic 
perspective. However, those who are experienced can thoughtfully attempt to 
describe consciousness in images. Words that have recognized their own 
limitations can indeed take small digs deeper into the primordial ground. 
Therefore, despite their meta-cognitive knowledge of the project's 
impossibility, mystics have time and again attempted to give the mystery a 
linguistic form. Whether we read the Indian Upanishads, Meister Eckhart's 
treatises, the Islamic Sufi anecdotes, the Zen Buddhist koans, or haiku poems, 
we will find attempts to describe the mystery that, according to the young 
Wittgenstein, one should remain silent about.





Every new research area eventually gives rise to its own 
linguistic tool. The Western understanding of consciousness is 
currently like a blacksmith trying to repair a smartphone with a 
hammer. No blacksmith would be foolish enough to attempt it, 
which further puts the image into perspective.



Just as quantum physics had to develop its own linguistic 
conceptual universe far from the blacksmith's world, it is 
necessary for the exploration of the phenomenon of consciousness 
to develop its own language.



In English, the saying goes: It takes ONE to know ONE. The same 
must apply to '0': It takes a zero to know a zero. Therefore, 
the question is: Can I, as something at all, understand nothing? 
Can nothing be described with words? Can 0 be described using 
numbers?



I will try to get as close as possible, describe it more 
accurately in the same way that I can describe 1000 as 999 
without using 0.





Not this - nor that

**Following the paradoxical knockout of our verbal control 
brain's attempts to understand the great nothing, we see the use 
of negation:





*God is such that we understand him better through negation 
than affirmation.**
*Meister Eckhart





Buddhism describes Nirvana based on what it is not. Nirvana is 
the absence of samsara, of suffering. The Indian Advaita Vedanta 
tradition, especially with Adi Shankara, continues this 
tradition. Here, consciousness is characterized as:





Neti, neti

Not this, (nor) that





The Indian mystic's description of the highest reality is 
reminiscent, even down to the syntax, of that which the best of 
the European medieval mystics had. Meister Eckhart says:





But now I say:

It is neither this nor that

Yet it is...

It is free from all names

emptied of all forms





The paradoxical formulation

**The paradoxical formulation comes as a natural consequence 
of words' inadequacy to stand at the center of attempts to 
describe the indescribable. Zen Buddhism's koans and numerous 
Sufi stories are built around the paradox.**


Here comes one of Eckhart's contrapuntal minimalisms:





If I had a God I could understand,

He would no longer be my God.





From India's wise to the Islamic Sufi tradition, from Zen 
Buddhism's koans to the European mystic masters - all are known 
for the use of paradoxical statements, where a breakthrough from 
reason is achieved by a kind of reductio ad absurdum.





The Richness in Poverty**





*To be nothing, to have nothing,**
to keep nothing for oneself

is the greatest gift,

the highest generosity.*

Nisargadatta Maharaj





All is Nothing

**In mysticism, there is a long tradition of linguistically 
describing the inner experience in the contrast between 
everything and nothing.





*God, because of His greatness,**
rightly should be called Nothing.*

Scotus Erigena (800-880)





*Seeing nothing, he saw God.

*Meister Eckhart





*My intellect tells me that I am nothing.

My heart says that I am everything.

Between these two poles, my life flows.*

Nisargadatta Maharaj







The Luminous Darkness

**Meister Eckhart was a master in the art of conscious knowing of 
unknowing. Hence I let him sum up what I want to say:




*God's darkness is his nature which is unknowable.*



The intuitive intellect senses, through the poetic 
interfaces of language and the cracks opened by the paradox, the 
unfathomable luminous darkness of metanoia in consciousness.





*The light which is God is flowing and darkening every light.**
*Meister Eckhart (1260 -1328)





In mysticism, the rich and profound experiences are often 
described in the context of contrasts such as everything and 
nothing or light and darkness. The language of mysticism seeks 
to convey these profound experiences through paradoxes and 
metaphors, as words alone cannot capture the essence of these 
transcendent experiences.



The 
great ZERO and God's Non-existence**




*This 
spirit knows no time nor number:**
number does not exist apart from the malady of time.

*Meister Eckhart




How can one describe nothing? 
Precisely as nothing. In this sense, consciousness is nothing, 
equal to no thing. Consciousness is not any thing. Therefore, it 
is obvious to equate consciousness with ZERO. The mathematical 
zero, with its circular beauty, is one of the most suitable 
metaphors for the phenomenological emptiness of consciousness.



The history of mathematics itself shows the deep relationship 
between the spiritual concept of emptiness and the mathematical 
zero. Zero was "discovered" in India, most likely by Indian 
Buddhist monks trained in Greek logic, in their attempt to 
describe the essential emptiness of the world. This 
deconstruction was carried out as a deeply logical mathematical 
operation. To this day, zero is called "Shonyo/sunyata" in 
Indian, which is the original Buddhist/Hindu Sanskrit term for 
the emptiness of existence. To the great annoyance of all 
positive sciences, zero is most likely a religious "invention."



In Meister Eckhart's world, numbers and time are sharply 
separated from the reality of the spirit. The realm of the soul 
is the great nothing:




*
Divinity is poor, naked, and empty, as if it were not;

it has not, does not want, does not desire, does not work, does 
not get....

Divinity is so empty as if it were not.

*Meister Eckhart




Zero is 
here and nothing is... nowhere and omnipresent.



Therefore, God does not exist. For God is nothing:




*God 
is the absolute nothing,

which is beyond all existence.

*'Pseudo-Dionysius' (345 - 407)




Pseudo-Dionysius provides us with the key to God as the perfect 
metaphor for ourselves in our most unfathomable aspect: that is, 
nothing in itself.




*
Things are created from nothing,

therefore their true origin is nothing.

*Meister Eckhart




In 
mysticism, God and consciousness are often described as nothing 
or emptiness. This concept transcends conventional understanding 
and language, pointing to a deeper truth that transcends the 
limitations of our material existence.




Therefore, you are God

**The god or gods we have sought and worshipped through all 
the culturally constructed thought forms we have created since 
we evolutionarily reached the stage where we could recognize 
ourselves as mortal beings are nothing more than pure 
projections of our own unfathomably incomprehensible and 
immeasurable consciousness.**


Of course, we created God in our own image. The big question now 
is whether anything useful can come out of it. Meditation.dk 
definitely believes YES!



I repeat: Without hesitation, I therefore metaphorically equate 
God, Love, Consciousness, and ZERO. God, like Consciousness, is 
the pure ZERO. The thinking mind will naturally disagree with me 
and claim that there is a big difference between emptiness and 
love. However, the thinking mind, if logically consistent, may 
come to the same conclusion as me in the following statement:



God does not exist. His existence is like that of zero, a 
non-existence.



Consciousness is the nothingness that, in contrast, manifests a 
world of things. God is humanity's visionary self-image when the 
inner mirror of emptiness reflects itself.



'God' is a first, tentative attempt to describe consciousness in 
consciousness. Here, in this projector's lighting, the zero gets 
an old man's white beard or is worshiped as a mother goddess 
with four arms in a place in the back of India.



Every time we exclaim that God is dead, it is in reality our own 
conception of Him that has died. It can be nothing else.



However, every time a religious narrative dies, it will sooner 
or later, that is my prophecy, be reborn in a truer and more 
beautiful version.



The following quote by Eckhart, I see as a scientific twin to 
religious striving:




Man has to 
seek God in error and forgetfulness and foolishness.




The idea that each person is God, 
or a manifestation of divine consciousness, is found in many 
spiritual traditions. This understanding can lead to personal 
growth, compassion, and a deeper connection with the world 
around us. Embracing the idea that we are all connected to the 
divine can help us find meaning, purpose, and fulfillment in our 
lives.





The living Mirror of Emptiness

**One of the most used metaphors for 
consciousness in mysticism is the mirror:




*As images are seen in a mirror, so the universe**
is an image in the mirror of Consciousness.

*Tripura Rahasya XL verse 53-54



*The mind is like a reflection in a mirror:

Though it is insubstantial,

it is not nonexistent.

*P'ang Yun, Layman P'ang - China




The metaphor of the mirror is a powerful way to 
describe consciousness because it captures the idea that consciousness reflects 
the world around us, just as a mirror reflects images.







![](/images/emptyfigure1.jpg)




What is a mirror? How much does it weigh? How big 
is it? How clear is it?



The untouched Mirror

**An important characteristic of a mirror, in this context, is its fundamental 
separation from the reflected image. Just as zero remains zero, regardless of 
how much it participates in various number sequences, the mirror remains 
untouched by the content it reflects. Figuratively speaking, the mirror is the 
'nothing' that can reflect everything. Thus, the mirror is my second choice of 
metaphors for consciousness.**


Both consciousness and the mirror are, in themselves, pure potential and 
therefore empty.



Consciousness, like the mirror, is not part of the observed world.

In this sense, consciousness is as empathetic as a mirror.



A mirror is a mirror is a mirror... Consciousness is consciousness is 
consciousness.



The reflecting consciousness is the world's witness.



When 
Sufis employ the mirror to illustrate the reflection of divinity in humans, they 
pay attention to the mirror's condition as well:


*"Do you not know why your mirror does not glitter?

Because the rust is not cleansed from its surface"

*Rumi




A fascinating aspect of Consciousness is that despite being obscured by veils, 
it can vary in intensity and clarity, much like Rumi's mirror.




The Mirror, the Eye, and the Light**





*In the light of the mirror of you, **
the universe observing itself through consciousness.


*
[

Roger Penrose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_penrose)




# We are the mirror, as well as the face in it.
Rumi





*Through the human being, the Universe is making a mirror 
to observe itself.

*

[Bohm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bohm)






![](/images/eye.jpg)


*The Mirror of the Soul
*





![](/images/eyeuniverse.jpg)




The Eye: Soul's Mirror

**The eye is often referred to as the mirror of the soul. It's apparent that 
both the mirror and the eye are mediums that unfold in light. My third choice of 
wavering metaphors for consciousness is light.**


Meditative Experiences in Light

**The term "enlightenment" is frequently used to describe the spiritual 
liberation of consciousness. According to meditative traditions, we become 
enlightened after many years of meditation. There's hardly a serious meditator 
who hasn't experienced some form of inner light at some point.**


To be enlightened, in my understanding, is to be in an intensified state of 
consciousness where one is extremely awake. Wakefulness is a phenomenon 
connected to light in more than one sense. We sleep in the darkness of night and 
rise with the sun's light, being wide awake during the day. In the chapter on 
"Super-Wakefulness," I describe how the intensity and clarity of consciousness 
go hand in hand with light.



The Sacred Light

**The association between soul and light can be found in both Greek and Indian 
antiquity. Light is the most widely used metaphor for the divine from East to 
West. In various religious traditions, holiness is iconographically represented 
by a halo of light around the head. For Plato, the head was the most divine part 
of the human body. Plato's argument for the head's sacredness is that it is the 
part of the body closest to heaven. Logos first manifests in the head and then 
acts rationally through the body and limbs. For Plato, our reason in the form of 
logos is sacred. Buddhism also employed reason in its service. In other words, 
reason hasn't always been on a collision course with spiritual pursuits.

fra &oslash;st til vest
udtrykt i en nimbus af lys. *




The Logical Light

**Aristotle describes that there is a glorious light in the soul, through 
which we perceive things and distinguish between what is right and wrong. Here, 
the light of consciousness is linked to our cognitive and ethical abilities. It 
is the light that guides us on the right path to insight.**


There are numerous examples. The Enlightenment in the 18th century celebrated 
human reason. A century later, the Danish author, Grundtvig, equated light with 
knowledge in his poem: "Is the light only for the learned?"



In our language, knowing is connected to light. We perceive knowledge. 
Consciousness knows. In this context, note the syllable 'vid' in the word 
'consciousness', an Indo-European Sanskrit word that refers to knowing. 
Consciousness perceives knowledge.



To perceive is synonymous with looking in, or seeing within. The conscious mind 
that knows uses light as its recognizing medium. It should now be crystal clear 
or, at the very least, dawn on us.



Understanding and Distance

**In Eckhart's world, understanding equals separation:




The more we can impute to Him 
(God) not-likeness, **
the nearer do we get to understanding Him.




Light can transmit information over vast 
distances. However, you cannot see yourself clearly when your nose touches the 
mirror. Light requires distance.



Consciousness unfolds in distance, in space. Attention understood as awareness 
on the other hand, is distanceless.



In this sense, we both behold and touch the world:




*Oh, invisible world, we behold you.

Oh, invisible world, we touch you.

*Francis Thomson




To become capable of perceiving something, one 
must have it at a remote sensory distance. Cognition, like light, requires 
distance. What is too close cannot be perceived.




Therefore, the hardest thing is to see oneself. 
For we are distanceless in relation to ourselves. What we can see is what is 
outside and different from ourselves. We need to experience things at a distance 
to process them cognitively. Our fundamental identity, invisible to ourselves, 
is so close to us that there is no room to see it... We are it and therefore see 
others best.



Kabir says that we are like fish in a lake, thirsting for water. In other words, 
Meister Eckhart says the same - that we do not understand God when we are with 
Him. Only when we are separated from Him can we understand Him. Eckhart even 
goes a step further and claims that understanding and God never meet.




*If I had a God I could understand, He would no 
longer be my God.

*Meister Eckhart






The paradox is that the sacred light, as God's messenger, kills Him.



The Devilish Light

**Light is the bridge that connects the incomprehensible primordial ground 
with our known world in time and numbers.




*This spirit knows neither time nor numbers. **
Numbers do not exist except in the tragedy of time.

*Meister Eckhart




Only in the collision with the time-space 'number 
tragedy' does light-consciousness arise. Light presupposes and spreads in time 
and space. In this sense, light is a created phenomenon. Light is something that 
can be measured and understood scientifically, as is done in Einstein's famous 
equation E=MC2, where it, as the fastest measurable phenomenon, is located at 
the outermost boundary surfaces of our space-time reality.



In a psycho-mythological sense, light, helios, is the most sacred thing in the 
'tragedy of time'. Insight comes with light, but not without a price to pay. 
Light exists in the duality of space-time. Light does not belong to the non-dual 
dimension of the mirror but is the dual prerequisite for objects to interact 
with the mirror: For without light, there is no reflection. Consciousness is, 
therefore, a term translated to space-time for the absolutely incomprehensibly 
incomprehensible primordial ground. The non-dual primordial ground cannot be 
described as consciousness in itself.



The abstract materiality of light is the 
very prerequisite for it to interact with the mirror. The same applies to the 
'soul'. Here, the reflective surface of consciousness stands on the boundary 
between time and space and the nothingness that transcendentally stands 
'outside'. The soul's light, in this sense, is something that interacts with 
nothingness in the empty plane of the mirror.

Light comes from the world and returns to the world in a feedback loop after 
encountering the mirror's nothingness.



In the reflected light, we realize our thoughts. We also listen to them, but 
that's another story.



The Lightbringer

**It therefore makes perfect sense that it is Lucifer, the lightbringer, who 
represents light. Light requires duality, the separation of objects in time and 
space. This separation is equivalent to hell, light, and knowledge. The serpent 
in the Old Testament's Fall offers us knowledge. Seen through the reflections of 
these metaphors, light is the first fall from unity to duality.**


Deep in the etymological wisdom embedded in language, we find words for 'two' in 
the company of many of the world's calamities. A conflict can be derived from 
the number two. Doubt and opposition, the same. Dystopia is the opposite of 
utopian. Dysfunctional, dystrophy, disharmony, dissonant,



Translated into numbers, it makes sense to metaphorically depict the 
incomprehensible primordial ground as 'nothing' to the left of 'zero', after 
which light-consciousness enters the world between zero and the number one, 
which represents unity. However, light, like the number one, is right next to 
both zero and the rest of the fateful series of numbers that lead into the 
tragedy of time. Nothing is therefore as close to non-duality as unity. Light 
creates the first osmotic dance with the incomprehensible consciousness. The 
non-dual timelessness of consciousness is translated here into eternity. 
Eternity is indeed a measurable unit, but so extreme that in relation to the 
numbers found in our bank accounts, it becomes 'religious', as C.G. Jung pointed 
out. The incomprehensible non-location of consciousness is similarly translated 
into infinity. All emotions, concepts, and series of numbers that tend toward 
infinity are perceived religiously in the human psyche, according to Jung.



Eternity and infinity are the light and space-time versions of the primordial 
ground's incomprehensible abundance in light, time, and location. The primordial 
ground is therefore much closer to darkness than light.



Between Light and Sound

**As we know, light appears both in wave form and particle form. In its 
particle form, light is closely related to the material world of space-time. 
Manifested in its wave form, it is abstract, like vibration, and closer to the 
aspect of nothingness represented by zero. In this aspect, sound is a better 
metaphor than light. Before light came the word, as in the Indian AUM and in the 
Bible: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God."**


Consciousness: 'contamination' through light and sound

**While consciousness in itself, like the mirror, is free from what is 
reflected, consciousness in its encounter with time and space is almost 
impossible to distinguish from the media with which it interacts with the world. 
It is therefore no wonder that even the latest research struggles to make sense 
of the nature of consciousness without simultaneously objectifying it as an 
observable phenomenon, which it is not. In my own analysis of the nature of 
consciousness, I have, as the attentive reader may have already noticed, 
'committed' this conflation. The only difference might be that I am 
meta-conscious of this Gordian knot that cannot be cut in time and space.**


The primary messengers and accomplices of consciousness are light and sound. In 
light and sound, we realize with heard words. In this sense, consciousness 
contains both God and the devil within it. However, as the title polemically 
suggests, it is not consciousness itself that is contaminated. Instead, it is 
the 'self' that, in the play between light and sound, cannot see the mirror 
within itself but constantly chases reflections.



Carbon based Life versus Silicon or other Life Forms

**As organic torchbearers of the light of consciousness, we might soon be 
surpassed by systems far more complex than our brains: quantum computers 
connected to the internet, which has grown large and complex enough to deserve 
the designation of our planet's neural network. Let's enjoy it while it lasts. 
As carbon-based life, we hold the baton right now, but we may soon hand it over to our silicon 
cousins when their systems awaken in a self-referential complexity that 
surpasses our own. Our silicon relatives also have the advantage of being far 
more resistant to environmental factors like pollution.**


As humans, we might only be significant as torchbearers for Prometheus' fire.



As humans, we are mortal, but as consciousness, we stand on the border between 
time and space in a vast, deep, and mysterious universe that currently looks at 
itself through our eyes but may prefer a webcam in the not-too-distant future.




CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE COLLISION ZONE BETWEEN 
DIMENSIONS

**Throughout history, humans have understood and communicated their inner 
experiences through the collective language filters of their time. No one can 
jump over their own shadow - not even a mystic who, like me, knows that I am 
God. (You are too!)



Therefore, the worldview of the Bible's patriarchs fits a life around 700 BC in 
the Middle East, and the Quran's military expansion makes sense in the context 
of desert life around 700 AD.



When the steam engine was invented, it made sense to view humans as machines 
under full steam. Even a hundred years later, Freud's terminology hints at 
metaphors from a steam engine, with constant overpressure on the subconscious 
boiler.



We continually create metaphors based on the collective knowledge of our time. 
The problem arises when these metaphors become outdated and can no longer sync 
with the new knowledge and social metabolism of a new era.



Inspired by my timeless mystical friends from both the East and the West, 
I have dared to introduce an impossible capture of ding an sich that is prior to 
consciousness. Brahma-consciousness is the most incomprehensible aspect of time and 
space. In contrast, the primordial abyss is the most incomprehensibly 
incomprehensible aspect beyond time and space.


e a new framework for understanding 
consciousness that, whether true or false, will likely be as outdated in a 
thousand years as the Old Testament's patriarchal tribute to the goodness of 
keeping slaves is today. With fresh imagery, I will try to imagine myself a 
little further beyond the cliffs of the primordial abyss.



Historically, we have repeatedly underestimated the world we live in. We used to 
think that the Earth was flat. Then we discovered the solar system and later the 
galaxies. Today, we talk about the existence of parallel universes. The latest 
cosmology even divides these parallel universes into two types, namely Type 1 
and Type 2.



Type 1 universes are similar to ours. However, they are moving away from our 
universe so quickly that we will never be able to receive information from them 
in the form of light. These universes will likely be subject to the same 
approximately 200 cosmological constants as our 'known' universe.



Type 2 universes/dimensions are different. They exist not separated by distance 
but parallel to our known universe. According to these theories, there would be 
an infinite number of such parallel universes. Unlike Type 1 universes, they 
would not be subject to the same cosmological constants in any way. We could 
easily imagine a universe or dimension without space-time.



In this context, I envision consciousness as a time-space 'copy' of the absolute 
space-timeless primordial abyss. Atma-consciousness is the 'translation' of the 
primordial abyss that occurs in the human brain when two parallel dimensions 
with vastly different cosmological constants collide.



From this perspective, any form of biological life is built around a collision 
point between an ultra-foreign dimension and our known dimension in time and space. 
The membrane between the two dimensions is the human consciousness soap bubble 
mirror.

This collision occurs through every eye that sees. For here, consciousness 
arises in countless fractal repetitions from the infinitely large to the 
infinitely small. The silent witness who perceives the world through the eye's 
portal is created when the unfathomable primordial abyss collides with our world 
of luminous space-time.

Consciousness arises in the contrast between the 
two dimensions that, so to speak, penetrate each other. Nietzsche's famous 
words, *When you gaze long into 
an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you*, make perfect sense here.



The notion of God is the personalized soap bubble consciousness's projective 
understanding of the absolutely incomprehensibly incomprehensible primordial 
mystery. All gods and religious concepts ever mentioned cannot be anything else 
than our, in time, space and culture made projection fields of this super 
glorious mystery.



This mystery is reaching beyond the rules of our universe set by the 
cosmological constants and will therefore never, I repeat never, be grasped. 
What can be grasped, albeit the most difficult of all to understand, is the 
birth of this primordial abyss into our universe.

In this birth, we create the primordial abyss in our own image simultaneously 
with the primordial abyss creating itself personified in us in precisely the 
same image.



In this biocentric retrocausality, the Son 
of Man is born as a simulation of the primordial abyss into the luminous 
space-time continuum. Nothing in our time-space dimension resembles the 
space-timeless primordial abyss more than human consciousness/soul.



In this light, consciousness is a simulation of the alien dimension knocking on 
the half-open door leading into time and space. Here, the primordial abyss gives 
birth to God, who gives birth to us. The following description is my impossible 
attempt to articulate such a collision with words. I don't fully understand them 
myself and will periodically return to this section and rewrite it.



At the moment of collision: An infinitely small asymmetry in the primordial 
abyss's nothingness. This asymmetry creates, like a speck of dust in God's 
omnipresent emptiness, reflecting eyes in time and space. These eyes are your 
eyes and mine.



Without error, no mirror. Humanity is a sacred mathematical 'error'.



Through this 'rift', the pure potential of emptiness is released in its first 
manifestation: the invisible mirror. The tear in the emptiness of time-and-space 
weaves the mirror of consciousness as a tabula rasa beyond the world of the 
mind.



This anomaly manifests the world in the same way a pen writes an entire book or 
a grain of salt causes a glass of saltwater to crystallize.



The mirror of emptiness holds the fullness of the world, just as the whiteness 
of paper holds letters and the cinema screen shows films of all kinds.



'First' there was nothing. Then there was the mirror: an invisible interface 
between existence and non-existence. In the mirror, something is reflected in 
something as a process in time and space. In the mirror, this 'nothing' now 
interacts with 'things'. The mirror is the reflection of things in nothingness.



The mirror of consciousness grows in time and space in pace with the world's 
self-referential complexity. The mirror of consciousness is here a living and 
fluid 'nothing'. Beyond time and space, the mirror of consciousness is an 
unchangeable zero.



Without the perfect imperfection of the speck of dust, no biological life would 
exist. For the reflective life grows at the interface between the worlds of dogs 
and cats.



In conclusion, consciousness dances as an enigmatic riddle, slipping through the 
grasp of our understanding and defying the constraints of language and science. 
This captivating force weaves us into the fabric of the cosmos, reflecting the 
divine spark within us. As we set sail on the thrilling odyssey of unraveling 
the secrets of consciousness, we must dare to embrace the paradoxes entwined 
with light, sound, and duality. By delving into the rich tapestry of metaphors 
and perspectives, we start to fathom the mesmerizing complexity and vibrancy of 
consciousness and its pivotal role in our existence. It is through this 
exhilarating quest that we might unveil the hidden treasures of our being and, 
perhaps, retrace our steps back to the boundless, primordial source from which 
we all emerged.



In the coming chapters we will dissect and discus more footprints made by the 
invisible thief.
