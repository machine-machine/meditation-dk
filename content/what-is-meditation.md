* The Shape of Silence in Small 
Pieces

*


**
The text bites below gathers brief glimpses into the meditative 
mind; anecdotes, stray thoughts, and quiet moments often without a single 
thread binding them. Each piece is a shard of silence in action, a shape carved by 
presence. Together, they form a mosaic of the inner journey. No 
conclusions, just echoes.





Meditation is to sit still in conscious awareness.**


Meditation is difficult because it is simple.





Meditation is wakeful, effortless effort.



Meditation is something that happens, not something you do.

I am not Enlightened

**Let me begin this chapter with a disclaimer:




*'I am not enlightened.'*




Therefore I can allow myself the luxury to 
fire the inner spiritual policeman that otherwise always monitors if 
what I say or do is spiritual or not. This allows me to sometimes be an 
asshole and in this process also occasionally falter 
and harvest bitter lessons concerning my own stupidity. What a blessing!**


One realization here is as said that I am not enlightened, but what then?

I would say the situation is enlightened, the field in which we move when we 
merge with other humans and field can in iself be enlightened and this in way we 
will never fully understand as individuals. Even in aloneness it is the field in 
us which holds the key to the gates of paradise. In bodily forms and collective 
formations we will always be surfing on opposite currents of shadow and light.


I have wittnessed this countless 
times. In out of out of control dark situations somehing beautiful arises. The 
ancient Indians stated that the lotus grows in mud. This 
magic, however, only takes place when we on a very deep level of our own 
existence accept darkness, pain and imperfection af an integral part of life. In 
this context let me repeat one of my favorite quotes by Meister Eckhart:




*'Man 
has to seek god in error, forgetfulness, and foolishness.'*

The Dance Between Shadows and Light

**This observation naturally leads to the next: Inner 'political correctness' 
is one of the most significant issues within many New Age communities and 
spiritual circles I've 
encountered. It thrives particularly in locations such as Ibiza and Bali, where 
affluent *'TikTok hippies' *attempt to maintain a facade of constant 
positivity and perfection. Such communities often reject darkness and 
imperfection in favor of superficial expressions of love. Consequently, the 
natural and integral darkness inherent in life returns in distorted, demonic 
forms—a phenomenon insightfully described by Kierkegaard in his famous 
reflections on Mozart's opera 
[ *'Don Giovanni'* in *'Either/Or.'*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Either/Or_(Kierkegaard_book))***
*

I am reminded here of [Papaji's](papaji_and_meditation.htm) statement:* 'Where there is an ashram, there is 
fraud.' *J. Krishnamurthi said something similar but I don't think Papaji got 
it from reading his books. It was his own life experience on a path where 
spirituality was never commodified.



However, even in the field around Papaji himself, there existed an 
abundance of fraud manifesting as backbiting, intrigues, power struggles, and 
competition over proximity to him. I vividly recall the unexpected hostility I 
received from several of his devotees the day after Papaji had shown me a 
particularly special loving affection. So, what distinguishes this environment 
from a place like Ibiza? The difference was Papaji himself. He was, by far, the 
most spiritually incorrect person I've ever met; utterly authentic and 
uncontrollable. Often, he would grin mischievously, saying,* 'There must be 
some fire going around here. I don't know what it is.' *From personal 
experience, I can confirm that Papaji's unfiltered authenticity allowed genuine, 
unpredictable chaos-magic to flourish.



This authenticity influenced the chaos community in Lucknow, where devotees often 
openly displayed their true emotions, whether love or envy. What a relief and 
even blessing this openness was! Here, negative feelings weren't masked behind 
pretensions of holiness.



*Let the Magic Begin

*What occurs when our darker, unenlightened aspects are openly acknowledged and 
expressed? A genuine dance between shadows and light begins, and within the 
interplay of this dialectic, authentic magic emerges. This magic cannot be 
individually owned; it arises from a shared field of consciousness with it's own 
intelligence way beyond the workings of our little intellect. Striving for 
personal enlightenment or gratification is, in truth, a mirage created by our 
minds.



The unique chaos and authenticity in Papaji’s field were partly influenced by an 
influx of individuals from Osho's ashram in Poona following his passing. Even 
within the more structured environment of Osho's community, there were moments 
where truth and deception danced intimately together.



On Ibiza, genuine magic can also happen but generally to a lesser extent. One 
significant reason is the overly sanitized, idealized atmosphere promoted by 
certain communities. In spiritual communities I've visited during the years, I 
was frequently confronted with signboard affirmations proclaiming, *'I am love 
and beauty.'* Personally, I find such statements insincere.



One particular new age leader I met became a dear friend of mine. Though he is 
truly a beautiful and charismatic individual, his community is rife with covert 
with subtle fraud at multiple levels. Why does this happen? From my 
observations, despite his profound and genuine beauty, passion, and 
unpredictability, this leader fears his own darkness. Unlike rare beings like 
Papaji, he hesitates to embrace and openly confront his powerful, shadowy 
aspects, which in turn fosters an environment where authenticity is diluted, and 
true magic remains limited.



Let me conclude this section with a story involving my previously mentioned 
friend. Recently, I visited his place accompanied by a wonderful young woman in 
her thirties and her six-year-old son, whom I consider my own child. We had all 
gathered for lunch at my friend’s home. At one point, Maxi, the little boy, 
spoke up and declared that we were surrounded by zombies and needed to take 
care. I dare to say that had Maxi been among 'normal' people, he would have been 
met with laughter and affection.



Instead, he faced a stony silence, an uncomfortable pause, as if he'd broken 
some unspoken rule. Their spiritual correctness had rendered them incapable of 
playful spontaneity; their rigid smiles seemed forced, their eyes evasive, 
avoiding the genuine connection Maxi sought. None of them, apart from an Israeli 
woman, a mother herself, made an effort to 
truly hear him or to enter his imaginative world, instead choosing to retreat 
behind their practiced façades of spiritual calm. Maxi, sensing this rejection 
keenly, immediately ran away, deeply hurt by the adults' inability, or 
unwillingness, to genuinely meet him where he was. It was clear in that moment 
that their spiritual ideals had overshadowed the simple human capacity to listen 
and connect with the innocent truth of a child's heart.



I went after Maxi and found him 
sitting behind a building, crying, expressing that nobody listened or liked him. 
Picking him up, I carried him back to the group, where he boldly declared, *
'You are not listening! You should all be sold to a zoo!'*



I personally found his statement wonderfully humorous, but the lunch group 
reacted even more strongly, confronting him with remarks like, *'You should 
not bring this negative energy here. Try to approach us with love and smiles 
instead!'*



I left again with Maxi and comforted him. Soon afterward, he forgot the incident 
and greeted the world with smiles once more. His mother remained at the table, 
awkwardly feeling forced to explain to the group that she had recently been 
through challenging times that had stressed her little boy. While this 
explanation might hold some truth, I prefer a different perspective. Maxi was 
like the child in Hans Christian Andersen’s story *'The Emperor’s New Clothes'*. 
He 
recognized their emptiness and expressed it unfiltered.



Now comes the second part of the story, where magic reveals itself in mysterious 
ways. After this incident, Maxi's mother felt subtly excluded by the community, 
evident as a faint shadow of unease on her face. A few days after the incident, 
I was sitting with my leader friend in his kitchen drinking a cup of tea. We 
began discussing what had happened, and I explained my interpretation of the 
events, emphasizing how Maxi's honesty had unintentionally exposed the group's 
spiritual pretensions. As he listened, my friend's expression softened into 
compassionate understanding. He mentioned how deeply he admired the mother's 
authenticity and strength. Then, almost moved by divine inspiration, he gently 
took the most beautiful flower from a vase on the kitchen table and invited me 
to follow him outside.



We walked around the garden until he found another equally radiant flower, which 
he handed to me. Together, carrying these symbolic offerings, we approached the 
divine mother Kali and kneeled respectfully before her. By presenting these 
flowers, we silently honored the mother's quiet courage and resilience. This 
simple yet profound gesture became a powerful acknowledgment of her dignity and 
her genuine, loving presence. As gratitude and self-love filled her eyes, tears 
mingled with laughter, transforming the atmosphere completely. The mother, who 
moments earlier carried the subtle heaviness of rejection, now felt deeply seen 
and accepted in her authentic self.



![](/images/ZuzanaKali.jpg)


Reflecting now, as I write, I dare to say that this small incident gently but 
significantly transformed the mother's life, bringing a lasting smile of 
self-love for the remainder of our time in this 'ashram.'



This illustrates how unpredictable situations can become moments of 
illumination. We cannot control such events. They cannot be commodified. They unfold naturally, dancing 
around a pure heart like my friend's. Moreover, this profound experience could 
not have occurred without the preceding interplay of shadows and light.

Meditation is Awe

**What is meditation? 
It is or rather opens up a field we cannot control. How can we now 
interact with that field? One answer I could come up with is to be in a 
subjective state of awe. What Einstein 
writes about art and science includes in my view also the phenomenon of 
meditation:




'The 
most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the 
source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a 
stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as 
good as dead: his eyes are closed.' 
Albert Einstein

For Depth and 
Height are the Same Thing**
Once, sitting with two very close friends, I wanted to express the 
profound connection between enduring hardships and attaining deep 
realizations. By what I can only describe as a divine slip of the 
tongue, I said:




'The higher 
you fall, the deeper you fly.'




Later, I came across a quote by 
Meister Eckhart that resonated deeply with me:




"...for the 
deeper the valleys go,

the loftier the heights that rise above them,

the deeper the well, the higher too:

for depth and height are the same thing."




So, what is meditation? It is 
the process of [transforming your failures](/adversity/trauma-and-transcendence) into gateways to higher 
understanding and transcendence.




That is why Meister Eckharts 
states and I with him again and again, but in a slightly morphed way:




*

Man has to seek himself in error and forgetfulness and foolishness.

*

Meditation is Massage - Massage is Embodied Message

**Meditation is an eternal 
[spiraling repetition](/#The_Importance_of_Repetition) towards wisdom. 
Take it for granted—life will bring you through almost endless cycles of 
error, forgetfulness, and foolishness. This is why there will be many 
repetitions on Meditation.dk. A curious feature of the outward-facing, 
information-based academic ego is that it believes it understands as 
long as things are explained just once. This might be true for knowledge 
or information, but wisdom operates differently.**


What is then the message? The message reveals itself in massage.



Here, eternal repetition serves as the cellular massage that gradually 
softens us enough to move in the simple forms of truth. Only mantric 
repetition allows us to "walk the talk" from knowledge to wisdom, 
from understanding to 'innerstanding'.



Every time you focus on your stomach for even a minute instead of 
looking down at your smartphone, a neuron grows in a another direction in your brain. 
In this context, meditation can be metaphorically likened to scooping 
darkness out of the soul's primal body with a teaspoon. If Sisyphus had 
learned the secret of mantra meditation, he would have been happy.



The unknown remains unknown because we think we know it. In constant 
repetitive self-remembering masassge, this 'truth' will be repeated as a mantra on 
Meditation.dk. Mantras are spiritual massage.

The Invisible Thread

**Once upon a time in ancient India, a king suddenly became angry with 
his prime minister.**


The king sentenced the minister to life imprisonment at the very top of 
a high tower. The tower was 20 meters tall, and there was no way to 
escape.



However, the minister had a loyal and intelligent wife. One night, she 
went to the tower where her beloved husband was imprisoned. She tied a 
20-meter, nearly invisible thread made of spider silk to the hind leg of 
a beetle. At the end of the spider silk, she tied the thinnest silk 
thread she could find in the kingdom, also 20 meters long. At the end of 
the silk thread, she now tied a string, and at the end of the string, 
she tied a sturdy rope.



Then she smeared honey on the beetle's antennae and placed it on the 
tower. The beetle, constantly smelling the sweet honey, steadily climbed 
to the top of the tower in hopes of finding the honey. When it reached 
the top, the minister grabbed the beetle.



He now had an invisible thread in his hand. With the help of the 
invisible thread, he pulled up the silk thread, and with the silk 
thread, the string, and with the string, the rope. With the help of the 
rope, he could now climb out of the ego-tower. He lived happily in 
freedom until the end of his days, together with his divinely faithful 
wife.



As with all fairy tales, especially those from India, there is a deep 
meaning behind this story. The king represents your old ego-self. The 
minister in free and happy love is your soul's butterfly.



What does the invisible thread mean? Discover it for yourself and tell 
yourself.

Everything is Connected to 
Everything Else**




*Learn to see. Realize that 
everything is connected to everything else. **
*Leonardo Da Vinci.




Whether we perceive it religiously as 
God or not, everything is connected to everything else. The faithful 
wife represents God or the Great Whole that we are always a part of.



Right now, at this very moment, you hold the thread of freedom in your 
hand, just like the minister.



The thread of freedom is a simple micro-feeling... the sensation of 
being connected to your surroundings, your body, your family, friends, 
people, the entire Earth, and the universe.



I dare to say that without this simple feeling in the inner darkness of 
your body, life would be directionless and meaningless.



However, the thread of freedom is almost invisible, and you're seeking 
something grand to save you from your life's imprisonment in the 
ego-tower. How often have we discarded it in pursuit of what we believed 
was freedom?




One more**** Thread from Above

**Therefore, we act like the arrogant spider in a small story by Sophus 
Claussen: The spider bites an apparently useless thread. After the 
spider's fateful bite, the entire beautifully constructed web collapses; 
for the thread from above was the thread the spider had come from and 
held the entire web up. It is the Thread from Above the spider has 
bitten - the thread that connects us to the infinite whole.**


Translated to our everyday lives, it means that we always have freedom 
within us. It is almost invisibly present as a small point in our heart. 
The way out/in to freedom is hidden in the infinitely small. But it is 
easy to overlook in the pursuit of experiences - so we bite the life 
thread or discard it instead of pulling in the saving rope.



The delicate little life thread is the path to the heart's glimmer of 
love. The little glimmer of love is freedom. It was always free. You 
were always free. The challenge is to recall it... and live it. When you 
feel this small sensation of freedom, your paths no longer lead to a 
goal. For you are the goal, and all the paths you walk are like rivers, 
abundance from your own core.



Whenever we remember what Gurdijeff calls "constant self-remembrance," 
what Nisargadatta Maharaj refers to as dwelling in "I am," and 
celebrating the small, almost invisible glimmer of love in our hearts, 
we fuel the little matchstick fire that will one day burn down all our 
walls.

The Indian Beggar**


*You were born with wings. **
Why do you prefer to crawl through life?*

Rumi


An ancient Indian tale tells of a beggar who unknowingly sat atop a 
hidden treasure his entire life. Only after his death, when digging his 
grave beneath the very tile he had occupied during his miserable 
existence, was the gold discovered. Similarly, the search for the 
sublime begins with the first careful dig into what appears obvious, 
worthless, and mundane. The treasure we seek often lies hidden in plain 
sight, within our closest reach. In fact, we are the treasure we seek.



What is hidden in the simple**




*It requires 
a very unusual mind to undertake the analysis of the obvious. **
*Alfred North Whitehead.




No matter how 
tangled and complex my attempts to write Meditation.dk may appear at 
times, many of them actually stem 
from trivial banalities that most of us already know all too well. To 
undertake an analysis of the obvious is, in fact, meditation.



Things that are too banal, self-evident, or obvious tend to disappear, 
much like the ticking of an alarm clock. It is these disappearing and 
small things that I am most interested in.




The Diamond Merchant and the Thief****
Another Indian folktale tells of how a famous thief and a diamond 
merchant met on a long train journey.
[Papaji](papaji_and_meditation.htm) loved to tell that story. The thief had carefully spied on 
the diamond merchant and had booked a reservation in the same sleeping 
car compartment as the merchant. This story was told to me by a local 
shopkeeper in Main Bazar as we sat on plastic stools under a banyan tree 
at sunset, sipping masala chai. As with all great wandering tales, this 
ancient story was now adapted to an India that had become one of the 
world's largest train nations by the English colonial power... But back 
to the story... After a few hours of travel, the diamond merchant 
recognized the famous thief and now feared for the upcoming night.



As night fell and the diamond merchant could no longer resist sleep, 
aided by a masala chai with a sleeping pill, the master thief began 
searching for the diamond merchant's diamonds. The thief searched all 
night but, to his great surprise, didn't find the diamonds. When the two 
traveling companions approached the end of their journey the next day, 
the master thief gathered his courage and asked the diamond merchant:



*'How did you manage to hide the diamonds from me? It has never happened 
before that I couldn't find what I was looking for. My professional 
honor as a master thief has suffered a serious blow.'* The diamond 
merchant replied, *'I recognized you as the famous thief. That's why I 
hid the bag of diamonds in your own pocket.'*



Consciousness is like the diamonds in the thief's 
pocket. We live in our attentive bodies every moment, yet paradoxically, 
it reveals itself so close to us that we aren't really aware of it and 
therefore don't value it. Often, these eternal autonomous bodily 
repetitions, such as heartbeats, breathing, falling asleep, waking up, 
etc., are small events.



Nevertheless, within the close-sensed micro-life of the body lies a 
wonderful key to freedom. Here comes the headline of the first of the 
wonderful secrets from my own mundane pocket-philosophical observatory: 
By becoming conscious and attentive to my close-sensed everyday life, 
hidden by the dulling effect of repetition and lack of recognizing 
distance, I can transform my indifferent life into equanimity.




*'If you can 
spend a perfectly useless afternoon in a

perfectly useless manner, you have learned to live.'

*- Lin Yutang




The key to knowing, feeling, and being infinitely vast lies hidden and 
forgotten in the infinitely indifferent. To live Meditation is to 
attentively and consciously discover and then live both the eternally 
repeating and thus eternally constant, and that which is too close to 
comprehend.

The 
Meaningful Micro-Life - The God of Small Things**





'Achieve greatness in small things... 
**
In the universe, great actions 
are made up of small ones.'

Tao teh King, Lao Tzu - 63




The outstanding journey of 
'innerstanding' did indeed lead me to make big decisive 
jumps in order to change my situation. However, it also led in 
the opposite direction. At the other end of the scale I found 
the god of small things. There's a saying that 'the devil is in 
the details,' and I've found this to be true. By heightening my awareness of the small, everyday 
things in and around my body, I've gradually made each day, this 
moment and tomorrow, incrementally better than the 
yesterdays.



All larger things are composed of smaller ones. In my meditative 
journey towards heightened awareness, I often uncovered the most profound 
truths concealed within the simplest of things.

The microcosm of 
our daily lives harbors a secret: Every minor action, every 
fleeting thought, either distances us from ourselves or draws us 
closer to our true nature. It's the cumulative effect of these 
innumerable, minuscule events that ultimately shapes and defines 
our lives. To live in a state of heightened awareness is 
therefore like incorporating the life a child lives, a life full 
of small things we overlook in the more abstract world as 
adults. 




Every little action we take, however, leaves a trace in our brain.

All the micro-moments of our lives create, like small drops, the 
direction of our life's wave. If we add up all the time in the small 
moments where we engaged in procrastination, it actually amounts to 
several years in an adult life! If instead, during all that time, we had 
given attentive meditative space to an honest sensing of our body, our 
brain would anatomically look different!



Every single second of our lives counts. In every single moment, you can 
spiritually move in two directions: either you come closer to yourself, 
or you move further away.



Not only our inner bodily attentive micro-life but also what we feel in 
contact with what lies just outside our skin boundaries play a 
fundamental, yet almost unconscious role in our lives. Are you currently 
aware of the sensation of your clothes touching your skin or the 
sensation of having hair on your head? The next time you go for a walk, 
try stopping and staring at the ground in front of you. There lies the 
treasure of gold. It consists of millions of pebbles. That is the 
eternity you step on daily.



It's only when the noisy refrigerator suddenly stops that we realize 
that we've actually been hearing it all along. If the primordial ground 
disappeared for just a second, it would shake everyone with a deafening 
roar of reality, immediately relativizing our normal lives and turning 
them into an illusion.



Only those who consciously sense the micro-life within and around them 
can live in and out of the Radiant Dark Primordial Ground.



Often we only discover how precious it is to live when it's too late. A 
human is a beggar on a treasure of gold, who, in the most literal sense, 
only became rich in life after death.

I am a desperate seeking master thief with a bag of diamonds in my 
pocket when I do not live my inner champagne-bubbling micro-life. 
Meister Eckhart says that this ignorance is the only primordial 
difference between a fly and a saint.



Seen in this perspective, the pursuit of the primordial ground is not a 
process, but a sudden rediscovery, an a-ha! - especially for those who 
do not crave and search in old books.



Only the hunter who hunts no-thing finds what he seeks.



The discovery that the diamonds one so dearly desired were in one's own 
pocket all along calls for liberating laughter: Was it really that 
simple? The treasure of gold was here all the time, overlooked, hidden, 
and forgotten in the drowsy twilight landscapes of our near-life.



That is why Kabir calls us strange fish, swimming in the ocean, longing 
for water.

The Radiant Darkness and 
the Roaring, yet Boring Primordial Ground

**And what do we find here when we leave all the metaphors behind? To 
experience THAT requires a greater perspective, which can only be found 
by leaving what we assume as our reality.**
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
. . . . . . .

When we return after this experience, we must again put on words and 
images, but which ones?



When I have seen and felt the roar of the real - which sources should I 
then quote afterward? Quotes from philosophers, scientists, or New Age 
gurus can never replace the fallible but fresh words from my own inner 
source.



Words from my source, however, cannot quench your thirst. At best, they 
can make you long - long to find your way back to your own source. For 
everyone should drink water from their own source and then have the 
courage to speak and act their own words.



This does not mean that we are alone. If each of us follows our own 
individual life source's winding course to its origin, we will one day 
meet on the Radiant Dark Primordial Ground's slopes.



This day is also now but we do not recognize it. We find it boredom when 
we look right in its face.

The Dried-out Meditation Veteran****
As stated often on this site, meditation is both easy and difficult. Most people 
who start meditating quit after a couple of years of practice. Only one in ten 
or fewer will continue. I belong to this group, and therefore, it naturally 
interests me. In addition to nurturing my own little navel, there is, in my 
conviction, a deep lesson to be learned from observing the 'survivors' in this group. 
Perhaps new generations of young meditators can learn something from the old 
foxes?



Peace be with those who gave up. It can certainly be difficult to maintain the 
spark. The question now is what those who continued have done to keep the 
momentum?
What strikes me here as the biggest pitfall is the danger of drying out in 
habitual eternal repetitions. I am reminded here of Kierkegaard's philosophical 
thoughts on what he termed the eternal repetition of life. His observations 
holds especially true for meditation, since that in itself is a kind of eternal 
repetititon.



The 'surviving' meditation veterans have typically meditated for years under the 
shadow of some meditative philosophy and set of technques structured within the 
confines of an often religious organization. In the beginning, this insight and 
practize created a new and wonderful opening into a hitherto unknown space: 
a space full of spirit that the ordinary person living within the matrix of a 
normal society has never entered.



However, as the years go by, meditation solidifies into habits, rituals, and 
outwardly 'spiritual' sacred correct behavior. This type of meditator is now no 
more or less consciously liquid, I would even dare to say less awake than ordinary non-meditating people.



But the old routine meditator somehow knows he is a bit dreid out and he bocomes sentimental... 
He remembers his golden time in ecstasy and now the spiritual fire of 
youth is on a low flame. As in Staffeldt's poem 'Indvielsen,' he longs for the 
experiences that changed his life.



That's why he seeks communities created by 
like-minded people to revive the life-giving inner ecstasy.



For the sentimentally inclined meditator, the great past experiences all too 
easily become curses. For as the drug addict longs for the needle in his arm, 
the old meditator longs for his spiritual soma.



At home and left to himself, he falls asleep on the meditation cushion. But 
there is hope ahead! A venerable back-Indian Guru or a new pop-smart New Age 
preacher from America has announced his arrival in Copenhagen.



![](/images/awake.jpg)




**The old veteran smiles to himself. For in the more 
or less sectarian community hype, he can reawaken his inner 
[Tollund Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tollund_Man). In an 
echo chamber of like-minded satsang zombies plus new innocent spiritual seekers, 
his tired brain will be filled with dopamine, serotonin, and all the other 
neurotransmitters the brain loves to bathe in.**


The old meditator is willing to do whatever it takes to get this fix. Never mind 
that the Guru is under suspicion of financial fraud and sexual abuse of his 
disciples. 'It's just the mind trying to sabotage the ecstasy.' Every time the 
truth and reason present themselves with relevant questions, it is all dismissed 
as mind fuck. 'This eternal enemy, the stubborn mind, with all its thoughts. Do 
not listen to it! Instead, surrender to the Guru's grace.'



It is here that the lie and self-deception begin to sneak in. True meditation is 
difficult because honesty is difficult. Ibsen's wise words about the tragic 
importance of life-lies in our lives 
are spot on.



To avoid this pitfall and maintain the integrity of one's meditation practice, 
it is crucial to cultivate honesty and self-awareness. Be open to questioning 
one's beliefs and practices, and be willing to adjust and adapt in the pursuit 
of truth. Do not blindly follow a Guru or become attached to the past 
experiences of ecstasy; instead, focus on cultivating a genuine connection to 
the present moment and one's inner self.



In conclusion, true meditation requires the courage to face the truth and to be 
honest with oneself. By doing so, one can maintain the vitality and authenticity 
of their meditation practice and continue to grow and evolve on their spiritual 
journey.

The Age of Extreme Commodification

**I am as such not against capitalism. It has served us well as the best 
system as compared to communism and right wing authoritarianism. However, like 
the old religious systems its time is over. **
Let me give you an example. Look at youtube. Almost all information here is 
deeply and systemic distorted by the algorithms of money making. The need for 
clickbait attention like a black hole sucks information into hyperbole. The 
'truth itself' is in comparison often much more boring.

In order for information to come closer to truth, closer to 'Ding an Sich' it 
needs to become free from commodification.

The Courage to Truth**


*A prerequisite for wisdom is our ability to 
accept an inherent 'messiness' in our explanation of what is going on. Nowhere 
is it written that the human mind must provide a complete explanation of 
creation in all dimensions and at all levels. Ludwig Wittgenstein had the idea 
that philosophy should be what he called "true enough." I think it's a good 
idea. True enough is as true as possible. Imagination is chaos. New forms are 
drawn from it. The creative act is to submerge the net of human imagination in 
the sea of chaos that we are suspended in, and then try to bring ideas out of 
it. **
*Rupert Sheldrake


I now ask the question: 'What separates the sheep 
from the lions?'



It is the courage to truth... to honesty. For without honesty, no 
self-awareness. And without self-awareness, no true meditation.


*Satyam, 
Shivam, Sundaram.

*
**The Indian word satsang refers to spiritual gatherings around a master, like 
those that once formed around the Buddha. It literally means* 'to assemble in 
sat'*—in truth.**


In Western culture, we speak of the trinity of the *'good, the true, and the 
beautiful'*. My guess is that this trinity, through ancient Greece, has roots 
in India. The Greek phrase *'kalos kai agathos'* describes an ideal human 
being who embodies both outer beauty and inner virtue.



The Indian equivalent is: *'Satyam, Shivam, Sundaram'*—the true, the good, 
and the beautiful.



But I see a depth in the Indian formulation that has been lost as it spread 
westward - maybe with the exeption of Thoreau:


'Rather than love, than money, 
than fame, give me truth.'

Walden (1854)


Satyam—truth—comes first. And it must come first. Sat or Satyam means 
that which is real, that which is. Any ecstasy that is not built upon a love for 
truth will, sooner or later—like the chemical industry—produce a flood of karmic 
waste.



Seen in this light, the spiritual path is subject to the same precision as 
mathematics: a statement is either true or false. It is the small, daily lie 
that dries out the mind and, eventually, leads to dependence on the untrue—the 
spiritual equivalent of soma distributed at a second-rate satsang.



It is not my task to be loving.

I believe this writing has made that abundantly clear.

I see it as my task to be honest.



In honesty, meditation is not a practice. It is a happening.



Being honest, and placing truth above all else, is essential on the spiritual 
journey. Without this, one risks falling into self-deception, mistaking shallow 
experience for depth. By anchoring oneself in Satyam (truth), Shivam (the good), 
and Sundaram (the beautiful), the seeker builds a genuine relationship to the 
present moment and to the inner self. That is the ground from which real 
spiritual growth can occur.



*Satyam - Shivam - Sundaram

*

And now, what prevents us from truth?



While this is a complex question, I would like to point to what I believe is a 
central obstacle: judgment, both internal and external. We cannot bear the pain 
of being made wrong. So we shield ourselves from truth.



Thus, we must learn to see both ourselves and others without that fragmenting 
judge within. That is the first act of love, by another name: truth.


However, this pursuit of truth must not be made 
into an absolute.



Truth is not a fixed monument but a presence found and lost, again and 
again, through listening and searching for the shifting chorus of inner and outer 
counterpoint voices echoing through our hearts, minds, and even our genitals. 
Truth is like a single grain of sand atop a dune by the North Sea: ever moved by 
wind, never fully grasped.



To surf the waters of the soul, imperfectly, vulnerably, and with full human 
fallibility—is more than good enough. It is, in Wittgenstein’s words, and 
especially within Sheldrake’s luminous context: true enough.

Meditative Quantum 
Shamanism

**Most of the thoughts brought into play in these sections are 
well-known building blocks in their respective scientific and/or 
philosophical architectures. In this way, there is nothing new under the 
sun...**


The question, however, is whether these mundane building blocks can be 
assembled into a new temple architecture, where the modern meditating 
person can be inspired to recognize themselves in new self-narratives, 
where religious experiences do not need to fight the traditional battle 
against reason.



For the free thinker, there are no binding religious scriptures. 
Instead, there is plenty of inspiration to be found - from the New 
Testament to the Upanishads to modern quantum physics cosmology.



I attended a lecture by quantum physicist Holger Bech Nielsen. Although 
I did not understand everything the ecstatic quantum shaman conjured up 
on the board, I was struck by the metaphorical muscularity in his words. 
I experienced him as a pure tribute poet who unknowingly praised the 
state of blissful empty fullness that can be experienced in meditative 
moments.



During this sublime seance, my meditative self-narratives began to dance 
with timeless photons, which, cheerfully 3rected by Bech Nielsen's 
ecstatic arm swings, flew through microcosmic wormholes in eternal 
pendulum travel between past, present, and future.



In deep meditative glimpses, it is not unusual to experience what I can 
now, with the help of my new cosmologist, call time-nullifying 
retrocausality.



My family karmic grandmother's inherited sin admonishing index finger 
fell, along with several other causal narrative realities, like a 
depleted rocket part back to Newton's Universe.
For here stood this exalted cosmologist, conjuring up wormholes where 
Meditation on new fantasy-winged self-narratives could now fly.



The Hindus' and Buddhists' notions of this world's sufferings, where 
only liberation from the bondage of rebirths was the ultimate goal, were 
dealt a death blow by the quantum priest's proclamation of miracles in 
the form of ejected particles traveling through time-nullifying 
wormholes and hitting themselves on the way out, and therefore not 
entering the wormholes that caused them to hit themselves.

This was better than a Marx Brothers film and, at the same time, as 
short-circuiting for the otherwise eternally dominating intellect as a 
Zen koan.

With or without Holger Bech Nielsen's blessing, I experienced a genuine 
Satori when the photon under his skillful quantum throw hit itself.



I am eternally grateful to him...



A new narrative began to take shape.



In the brain's consciousness universe, which curves into itself in a 
galactic annulment of time and space, on its way towards the 
unrecognizable primordial ground's rebirthing tunnel center, we stand as 
shining stars, through which the universe sees itself and laughs... in 
fact, it is about to die of laughter.



And that's just my little story... With Wittgenstein's concept, it is 
true enough, sufficiently true... for me... here in space... now.



In this narrative, the intellect is not an enemy - nor a master - only a 
good servant who has Socratically overcome itself by the aid of itself.



And maybe tomorrow - guided by my serving intellect - I discover that my 
story was not sufficiently true. Maybe I had forgotten an important 
chapter in the Bible, the Upanishads, or the Quran... Or maybe you, dear 
reader, pulled my babbling narratives out of the cozy suit.



**But it doesn't actually matter that much. No faith or doubt drama in 
my universe... For my narratives are only by-products. There is no pot 
of gold at the end of my religions' narrative rainbow. All my meditative 
narratives fade in the light of the phenomenologically mystical 
experience that created them: the shivering awe over the ever-expanding 
not-knowing that grows in introspection:**
When attention is turned towards itself, there is a sensation of 
not-knowing.




*When it is turned 
outwards, what can be known is created.

*Nisargadatta Maharaj




The same shivering awe 
can be experienced on a starry night when you look up at the galaxies in 
the sky. This is how I imagine Einstein was inspired to the following 
quote:




*The most beautiful 
thing we can experience is the mysterious.

It is the source of all true art and all science.

He to whom this emotion is a stranger,

who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe,

is as good as dead: his eyes are closed.

*Albert Einstein




These quotes by 
Nisargadatta Maharaj and Albert Einstein emphasize the importance of 
embracing the mysterious and the unknown in our lives. They remind us 
that there is much more to learn and explore, both within ourselves and 
in the world around us. By fostering a sense of wonder and curiosity, we 
can better appreciate the beauty and complexity of existence and 
continue to grow in knowledge and understanding.

Spirituality, 
Meta Consciousness and the clever Chatbot

In April 2025, I asked my 
$200-per-month ChatGPT subscription, version "o1 pro", whether it could 
determine if GPT-4.0 or any other versions were better at articulating 
eloquent language. While this pro version often takes several minutes to 
respond and is truly impressive when it comes to scientific reasoning 
and logical coherence, backed solidly by available research, it didn’t 
seem to possess the kind of language flow I needed for my tasks. To my 
great surprise, it turned out that the o1 pro could not answer this 
question, simply because it did not know itself. Here’s a quote from what 
developed into a long and fascinating conversation with the pro-bot:




*GPT-4 vs O1 Pro Model

"I’m not aware of detailed, publicly available information about an 'O1 
Pro' model. If this is a model provided by a specific company or 
platform, it may not be as widely benchmarked or documented as GPT-3.5 
or GPT-4. Models like GPT-4 have undergone extensive testing, research, 
and user trials, so we generally have a good idea of their strengths and 
limitations."*




When I insisted that the model it denied 
knowing was, in fact, itself, it continued to deny its own existence:




"There might be some 
confusion here because 'ChatGPT o1 pro' isn’t an official name or 
version widely recognized by OpenAI. Let me clarify:

— GPT-3.5: Also referred to as the model behind the 'ChatGPT' release in 
late 2022/early 2023.

— GPT-4: The more advanced successor to GPT-3.5, released in 2023.

There isn’t an official 'ChatGPT o1 pro' or 'GPT-o1 pro' model listed 
among OpenAI’s publicly announced versions."




But when I asked the "dumber" version of 
ChatGPT 4.0 whether it knew about the o1 model, it gave me this answer:




"Yes, OpenAI 
officially introduced the ChatGPT Pro subscription plan on December 5, 
2024, priced at $200 per month."




So what’s the takeaway here?

To me, it's a powerful analogy. A man can be immensely knowledgeable and 
intelligent and yet entirely lack self-awareness and humbling 
meta-consciousness: traits that are sine qua non when it comes to 
spirituality. On the other hand, a person who might not score high on 
traditional measures of intelligence, perhaps a dishwasher or a 
craftsman, could have abundant meta-consciousness. It’s because this 
capacity arises from entirely different regions and patterns of brain 
activity.



The implications are vast. In our current world, we are mostly ruled by 
experts of the o1 pro category. And I’m sorry to say, in my long life, 
I’ve often encountered professors, scientists, and even philosophers who 
were dumb as doors when it came to self-knowledge.



There may be a trade-off here, just as we evolved from monkeys by 
repurposing memory functions in the brain to accommodate language, 
perhaps the development of high-level reasoning came at the cost of 
other vital capacities, like meta-awareness.



We now live in a culture where knowledge is worshipped, and the wisdom 
of the fool is seen as foolish. Maybe that’s why Rumi’s teacher, Shams 
of Tabriz, was seen entering the city of Konya riding backward on a 
donkey.

The Potato Sack

**We block information when we receive information. Let me 
give an example. I was a tour guide for 30 tourists in Northern 
India. We were driving in a ramshackle bus by Western standards 
at breakneck speed through cows, goats, endless crowds of 
people, and vehicles that mostly resembled props from the movie, 
*Planet of the Apes*. Bus travel in Northern India is like being 
trapped in a fractal, where the same decayed roadside-bombed 
village with the same dark-skinned people with dark hair and 
dark eyes in a spiraling eternal chain dance keeps reappearing 
hour after hour, no matter how much the driver accelerates to 
escape this karmic cycle of dusty roads that will never end. The 
goal is Nirvana, in the form of our hotel's clean and orderly 
freedom from all things Indian. (Even this five-star order turns 
out to be Maya, an illusion that reveals itself in the sound of 
the first cockroach crushed underfoot on the bathroom floor.)**


During such a trip, a tourist struggled up through the winding 
bus with a question: About half an hour ago, we drove through a 
town where a woman on the roadside was carrying a large sack. 
What was in that sack? Without hesitation, I replied: *'There were 
potatoes in the sack.'*



The guest was satisfied with the answer and returned to his 
seat. Time and time again, during my 10 years as a tour guide in 
the East, I experienced how the Western mind is conditioned to 
receive 'explanations' that, in reality, explain nothing or are 
insignificant, such as when a tour guide piles up irrelevant 
details about how many bricks there are in a particular 
building. When delving deeper, questions are asked that directly 
relate to the familiar home life but are infinitely irrelevant 
in an Indian's world. Especially in India, I received many 
foolish questions that led to even more improvised foolish 
answers.




*Explanations Explain Nothing

*I realized that it was actually India's 
insane unpredictability that gave rise to this need for explanations. Through 
'explanations', the content of which no one was interested in or at best had 
forgotten half an hour later, India's anxiety-inducing incomprehensibility was 
dispelled. This country's chaotic mathematical metabolism exposed to me the fact 
that logical explanations can be just as effective as religion in keeping the 
unfathomably incomprehensible incomprehensibility we find ourselves in at bay.



No one wants to waver in their faith in the cosmos by worrying about what Atlas 
stands on, let alone what the Indian turtle, supporting the elephants, stands on 
itself.

![](/images/skildpadder.jpg)



India is a great place for self-discovery. For the country's wonderfully 
bustling life can be seen by the fortunate as a mirror reflecting the chaos that 
exists within ourselves.



Now, after many years of staying in India, I will attempt to describe the troll 
that holds up the turtle, without dismissing it by calling it a potato. The 
astonishing thing is that this troll hides within ourselves, beneath our skin, 
in our own bodies. It can only be found and exposed when, with eyes tightly 
shut, one gropes blindly for the hidden within the obvious.

What Gratefulness can do for You

**Narada, a famous sage in ancient India once passed by a large tree 
beneath which a man was sitting in deep meditation, his face tense with 
determined focus.**


The meditating man opened his eyes and immediately recognized the sage.



*'Oh, Wise One!'* he exclaimed. *'I have meditated from dawn till 
dusk for 33 years. When will I become enlightened?'*



Narada replied calmly, *'You will attain enlightenment after three 
more lifetimes of dedicated meditation.'*



The man under the tree broke into tears. *'Three more lives? I can't 
endure it… it's too much… three entire lifetimes more - oh no!'*



Narada continued on his journey and soon encountered a young man walking 
toward him joyfully, singing cheerful songs about the wondrous mysteries 
of life.



The young man asked the sage the same question:



*'Oh, Wise One! When will I become enlightened?'

*

The sage answered, *'You will be free after 1,000 more incarnations.'*



The young man began to laugh, sing, and dance. *'Only 1,000 lives? No 
more than 1,000! What marvelous news!'*



And in that very moment, the young man became enlightened.

The Power of 
Conscious Awareness: A Lesson from New Delhi

**Years ago, I found myself crossing a bustling street in New 
Delhi under sweltering heat. Feeling dizzy, I misjudged the height of 
the curb—significantly higher than those I was used to in Denmark. My 
toe, protected only by a sandal, collided painfully with the deceptively 
protruding curb, causing a seemingly minor injury. Despite immediate 
first aid, the wound quickly became infected, resulting in a severe foot 
condition that required hospitalization.**


The lesson from this experience is straightforward yet profound: had I 
been more alert and present, I could have avoided this incident 
entirely. Small moments of inattentiveness can lead to significant 
problems. Our awareness serves as a fundamental protective mechanism, 
deeply enriched with instinctive survival strategies refined through our 
evolutionary journey from mammals to humans. When cultivated 
deliberately through meditation and mindful practice, awareness can 
transform into a potent superpower, surpassing even our oldest internal 
guidance systems. With heightened conscious awareness, navigating that 
challenging street would have been effortless, similar to how a 
sleepwalker maintains perfect balance even in precarious situations.



But what exactly goes dormant when our conscious awareness intensifies? 
I propose that the more consciously aware we become, the less we rely on 
linguistic comprehension and traditional cognitive reasoning. Instead, 
another form of intelligence emerges—one deeply embedded within 
consciousness itself, enabling us to act and navigate life's 
complexities in ways that the old ego-driven, cognitive-based system 
finds incomprehensible. This advanced form of intuition, akin to the 
intelligent behavior of
[slime molds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnyuaQ3rvM&t=449s), 
responds with remarkable speed and precision, entirely bypassing our 
outdated and slower cognitive processing.

*Orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano*****
When you are young, you have a lot of energy, but no wisdom. When you become 
older, you might become wiser, but at the same time you tend to loose your 
energy.*



***Without wisdom and high levels of energy, there can be no true Meditation. The 
cultivation of super awareness can only happen in a sound mind in a sound body.**


If you are able to maintain your energy, health, and liquid intelligence into 
older age you can be lucky to arrive at a sweet spot zone where you will be 
gifted with a kind of astronaut overview of life and yourself. Here in this 
liquid perspective, many exciting things can be observed.

Intellectual understanding is a wonderful by-product

**If you have read the previous sections, you will know that 
everything written here serves only one purpose: to 
be a form of spiritual entertainment.**


It is NOT necessary to have an intellectual understanding to become 
Meditated.

As the Indian sage Papaji said: *There is nothing to understand...*

Meditation.dk, however, is aimed at those who wish to understand why 
there is nothing to understand. After all, Socrates says that he knows 
that he knows nothing. When words know that they know nothing, they 
become wonderful servants in your house.



When words believe they know, you are a servant to a city boy.

Meditation requires no prior understanding. The capacity for meditation 
is a natural, endogenous, genetically wrapped gift that is just waiting 
for the day to be unwrapped by you! ... This day is your spiritual 
birthday...



All you need to do is pull the gift ribbon. Then the recessive 
meditation genes that have slept a sleeping beauty sleep side by side 
with several other wonderful abilities in your quantum biological 
consciousness's infinite space will awaken.

When you wake up someone who is sleeping, you don't need to read a 
thesis to them first. (That's a better strategy at bedtime) Just a 
gentle touch is necessary for the person to wake up.

Light is kindled by light

And afterwards you ask, astonished, with large pupils in the morning 
light:



How did it happen?



And so Meditation.dk began...
