The Civliizatoric Evolution of Consciousness

CIVILIZATION AND CONSCIOUSNESS - PART II****
The historical exploration of civilizational self-control 
presented [in the previous chapter](/civilization/civilization-and-consciousness) provides several significant 
insights, which we will now examine more closely. In this 
exploration, we aim to broaden our perspective, seeking a 
higher-level understanding through more abstract overviews.



Man is a story-telling animal

**Firstly, it's evident that the development of self-control 
in civilized human isn't solely the product of advanced 
cognitive abilities like logical reasoning. There seems to be an 
additional, highly effective mechanism within the modern human 
brain aiding self-control: storytelling, particularly through 
organized religion. Contrary to the perspectives of staunch 
scientists like Dawkins, who regard religion as a detrimental 
mutation, historical observations, such as the development of 
the Silk Roads, reveal the essential role of Buddhism and 
Christianity in facilitating crucial trade lifelines.**


The Rational and the Religious Mind

**Unlike animals, humans have a unique propensity for 
religion. Religion appears to be an effective narrative-based 
social self-control tool, rooted in our capacity for 
storytelling. [Yuval Noah 
Harari](https://www.ynharari.com/) accurately describes humans as storytelling animals. 
The existence of the Silk Roads owes much to religious 
narratives. The contemporary human consciousness seems to 
encompass two historically conflicting brain functions: the 
rational and the religious mind.**


It's crucial to note that this historical perspective doesn't 
necessitate actual belief in any religion. Our focus is on the 
unifying and civilizing influence of organized religion, which 
is a distinct matter from the existence of a deity.


FROM MEDIEVAL EXESS TO THE RATIONALITY OF ENGLIGHTENMENT

**Transitioning from the Silk Roads, we encounter another 
significant shift in the trajectory of civilization. This shift 
originated in the Italian city-states during the 15th century 
with the Renaissance, eventually evolving into the Age of 
Enlightenment and shaping Western civilization. **



Europe's geography, being more condensed compared to the 
expansive civilization zone of the Silk Roads, allowed for a 
unique blend of control systems. The vastness of the Silk Roads 
region made reliable military control challenging. In contrast, 
Europe's smaller geographical scale enabled the effective 
combination of military and religious systems for governance and 
control.


The Sensuous Middle Ages

**Even in the much later period of the Middle Age, the average 
person lived more spontaneously, acting on immediate sensory 
experiences, at least as compared to our time. According to
[Norbert 
Elias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Elias) this immediate, 
sensory, yet unpredictable life was led without considering 
potential consequences. Distress, captivity, defeat, victory, 
mutilation, unrestrained pleasure, devastation, religious 
penance, and remorse were experienced within the silent and 
sensory space of the body. Surveillance and punishment came from 
external forces like religious and secular institutions, not 
from within.

Enlightenment and Emotional Regulation

**Even up to the Enlightenment, societal norms allowed behaviors 
unthinkable today, like a man greeting a woman by touching her chest. People 
of the pre-industrial era engaged in direct, uninhibited sensory 
experiences.**



Norbert 
Elias's observations in "*[The 
Civilizing Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Civilizing_Process)*," 
elucidate

the transition from the Medieval to the Enlightenment period 
implied emotional self-control:

*"The soul is 
here, if one may express oneself thus without comparison, much 
more prepared and accustomed to leap from one extreme to the 
other with always the same intensity, and often even small 
impressions are uncontrollable associations, enough to trigger 
the fear and the turnaround. When the structure of human 
relations changes, when monopoly organizations are formed for 
corporal violence and instead of the persistent feuds and wars 
the more stable urgency situations due to peaceful, money- or 
prestige-acquired functions keep the individual in tight reins, 
the affective expressions slowly strive towards a line in the 
middle.**" (My emphasis)*

Norbert Elias's concept of the *
line in the middle* is not so far from Buddha's concept of *
the golden middleway* as discussed in
[
the previous chapter](/civilization/civilization-and-consciousness#Buddhisms_Middle_Path_as_a_Cultural_Modus_Operandi_).**


Norbert Elias highlights that as 
we progressed in the process of civilization, we transformed 
from beings *reliant* on close-range senses to those predominantly 
guided by long-range, visual perceptions. In this evolution, the 
term "Enlightenment" carries a significant implication 
as a visual sense.



Emotional regulation became crucial, and our sensory experiences 
shifted from direct tactile engagements to more distant 
observations. This transformation is encapsulated in the term 
"Enlightenment," which defines the post-medieval "Age of 
Reason." For 17th-century thinkers, "[the 
Golden Middle Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_(philosophy))" emerged as a paramount self-control concept, which can 
be seen as history echoing itself.




This is precisely why I chose to take a brief detour from the 
Silk Road to later European history. 
Throughout the 
history of civilization, dating back to pre-medieval times, our 
evolution has been characterized by a shift towards becoming 
more composed individuals in more harmonious settings. 
Consciousness, as the most recently evolved operational system, 
finds it challenging to manage intense emotional disruptions, 
which can be viewed as remnants of older, more primitive 
animalistic systems. Given its recent evolutionary emergence, 
consciousness is inherently fragile and prone to regression. As 
such, fostering self-control is crucial for the development and 
maintenance of conscious awareness which again is a foundation 
for higher organized civil life.



In this context, when we examine Buddhism and Christianity, we 
find a common focus on maintaining control over the higher 
mental faculties always threathened by animal nature. Buddha faced his battles against Mara and 
various demons. Jesus contended with the devil in the 
wilderness. Monks from both traditions strive to overcome their 
desires and the more base aspects of their minds.



From this perspective, modern new age religions appear to be 
engaged in the inverse task: liberating our senses from the 
burdens of excessive civilization. This aligns more with Greek 
and Roman religions, where figures like Dionysus symbolized a 
more hedonistic approach and held a place among the gods.



To Winn is to Loose

**
This reversed role of 
modern religious sentiments highlights the success of organized 
religion in civilizing humanity to the extent that it created 
environments conducive to the flourishing of consciousness. 
In Zen religion there is a saying:* To winn is to loose.* Christian institutions were so effective in this regard that 
they eventually made their own role in maintaining societies 
via religious sentiment redundant. **


The French Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire famously remarked,
*"There is no God, but don't tell that to my servant, lest he 
murder me at night."* This statement captures the essence of 
a time when, despite the declining influence of religion among 
the educated classes, it remained a vital moral and social 
anchor for the masses. Voltaire outlived the strict religious 
observance of his servant, symbolizing the enduring impact of 
religious belief even as it waned in the Enlightenment era. In 
this period, the notion of acting morally and maintaining order 
increasingly became seen as rational and self-evident, 
independent of divine decree.



The embedded embodiment of the story of goodness

**The original teachings of Buddhism on the Silk Road eventually 
evolved into Christianity. Christianity itself then transformed 
into a largely unspoken, but deeply ingrained memory of good 
conduct within societal structures. This code of behavior, 
embedded in the body, paved the way for an enlightened state 
transitioning towards secularism. By this stage, religious 
reminders to be virtuous were no longer necessary. The social 
ethos of good conduct had become a silent yet potent force, 
resonating from person to person, beyond the realm of language.
**



A significant shift in this process occurred in Northern Europe with the 
Reformation, allowing state power to integrate with religious 
institutions. It's important to recognize that most of societal 
information is non-verbal. This includes a range of 
communications from body language to emotions, which are 
transmitted in societies, often unnoticed by a Western mindset 
overly focused on linguistics and often oblivious to non-verbal 
forms of information.



The evolution of state-building where religious institutions 
have become integrated into the societal subconscious is 
particularly evident in the social democratic models of 
Scandinavia. In my country, Denmark, deep religious beliefs are 
far less common than they were in my grandparents' generation. 
Yet, there persists a general trend of people behaving kindly 
towards one another. This can be seen in the context of a social 
system where the state, providing comprehensive social security 
for all citizens, has emerged as a kind of anonymous embodiment 
of the Good Samaritan.



Ludwig Wittgenstein's assertion in "Tractatus 
Logico-Philosophicus" (1922), "The limits of my language mean 
the limits of my world," appears somewhat deceptive when 
considering the extensive, unspoken social currents of 
behavioral information. While Wittgenstein acknowledges the 
existence of phenomena beyond language, he advises silence on 
such matters. It's puzzling why he suggests this restraint. Why 
should we remain silent about what lies beyond the realm of 
language? This aspect of his philosophy is challenging to 
comprehend. I dare to disagree and align with Whitehead:


*An enormous part of our mature experience 
cannot be expressed in words.*

Alfred North Whitehead



Language-centric perspectives on human interaction and societal 
norms often overlook the zoological aspects inherent in us, 
aspects that have journeyed through time like a starship teeming 
with various inhabitants such as viruses, bacteria, 
mitochondria, and a multitude of cellular formations. A common 
denominator unifies all these biological operative systems: 
their ability to communicate without relying on language.



THE EMERGENCE OF NON-DUAL CONSCIOUSESS

**It is now time to elevate our discussion to consider consciousness as 
an abstract, shared field that unites humans at various levels, 
ranging from individuals to clans, tribes, nations, and beyond. 
For a deeper understanding of this concept, I recommend reading 
the chapter titled "[Shared 
Fields of Consciousness](/fields/fields-of-consciousness)"
before proceeding further.
**


Let's return to the Silk Roads to explore the emergence of 
non-dual consciousness. The link between the expansion of trade 
networks and the development and configuration of consciousness 
is intrinsically intertwined. Simply put, the concept of unity 
consciousness, which grew alongside urban development and the 
prosperity brought by long-distance trade, is simultaneously a 
fundamental necessity for the survival and thriving of these 
very developments.



Cognitive consciousness inherently functions within the duality 
of subject and object, the knower and the known. Similarly, 
tribal consciousness operates in a duality, consistently 
differentiating 'us' from 'them.' Religion has often reinforced 
this tribal dualism by categorizing people into believers and 
non-believers.
Both the shamanistic hunter-gatherer and the later 
agricultural-based cultures were 
fundamentally based on and in a dual consciousness and the split 
understanding of reality made by of the same.



Buddhism, however, presented a completely new transformative 
approach. Through the cultivation of consciousness in its 
essential form, it transcends these almost biologically 
inherited tribal divisions.



There are many ways of understanding non-duality.
In this context, by non-duality, I am referring to a state where 
Buddhist '*shunyata*', or emptiness, encompasses everything, 
particularly recognizing all living beings as part of a unified 
whole. Here non-duality takes us from the understanding of that 
there is no 'other', to the understanding that I am everybody 
else.



This inclusive acceptance was crucial not just for the 
long trade routes crossing diverse regions with different 
cultures and languages, but also for the emerging urban life on 
the Gangetic plains and in the series of Greek cities from 
Greece to India. A feudal or tribal mindset, less suited to life 
in populous cities, necessitates the coexistence of people from 
varied backgrounds and beliefs. Here, Buddhism addressed a 
societal need, aligning with the principle of 'follow the 
money'. It presents Buddhism as a socially adaptive force 
promoting harmonious coexistence in diverse environments. To put 
it succinctly: Buddhism, perhaps alongside Jainism, extended 
compassion not only within its group of adherents. Its concept 
of *['metta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitrī)*' (loving-kindness) embraces everyone, regardless of 
caste, creed, or culture, in a spirit of universal oneness. This 
represents a significant breakthrough in civilizational 
development.



Christianity eventually embarked on a similar journey. However, 
this path paradoxically coincided with relentless religious 
conflicts, either among different Christian sects or against 
Islam. However, the Christian mystics kept this



My favorite Mantra: What the Fred knows Fuck about 
Consciousness

**How can we look at this from the level of higher 
understandings of consciousness? Let me first of all repeat my 
mantra that we fundamentally do not know what consciousness is. 
In order to understand consciousness we should be on a higher 
level as consciousness itself, what we will never be, at least 
in the understanding that consciousness is a guest, an intruder 
from a higher dimensiona plain.
[
Consciousness is a cat from another dimension.](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia#A_CAT_FROM_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_) However, it 
is possible to look at some of the 'lower' aspects of 
consciousness, like described in the anology af the
[
footsteps of the invisible thief.](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia#The_Enigmatic_Buddhas_Footprints_)

When considering consciousness 
from a more elevated perspective, it's imperative to acknowledge 
a fundamental uncertainty: we don't truly understand what 
consciousness is. To fully grasp consciousness, we would need to 
be on a level higher than consciousness itself, which seems 
unattainable, especially if we consider consciousness as an 
entity or phenomenon originating from a higher dimensional plane 
– akin to
[
a cat from another dimension.](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia#A_CAT_FROM_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_). Nonetheless, we can examine 
some of the more accessible aspects of consciousness, as 
illustrated in the analogy of tracking the
[
footsteps of the invisible thief.](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia#The_Enigmatic_Buddhas_Footprints_)**


Consciousness mirrored in complex feedback system****

**Consciousness, as I intuit through deep meditation, is 
mirrored in biological 
multifaceted and complex information systems, possessing profound 
feedback capabilities. The complexity and efficiency of this 
system, even from a Darwinian perspective, correlate with the 
expansion of consciousness in both quantity and quality. Viewed 
in this light, consciousness involves the interconnection of 
neurons linking various parts of the brain, similar to how the 
Silk Roads served as cultural conduits. Consequently, 
consciousness had to broaden, akin to an expansive embrace, to 
cover the immense geographical stretch from India to Europe.**


Rings of Power****

**The first layer of 
consciousness is focused on individual survival, which is why we 
refer to parts of our body as 'my arm' or 'my leg'. The next 
layer extends to encompass our immediate environment, including 
'my things', 'my land', and most importantly, 'my loved ones'. 
Our consciousness, in this regard, expands in relation to what 
we identify with as 'mine'. Anything perceived as not 'me' or 
'mine' is often viewed as a potential survival threat. The 
subsequent layer is the tribal one, which in the era of social 
media has evolved beyond a physical clan striving for collective 
survival, transforming into a community of souls connected in 
their chosen digital rabbit-realms.**


At its more basic levels, this tribal consciousness is often 
governed by a 'Gollum-mentality', focused on possession and 
self-interest. It's only when this consciousness transcends 
itself, dissolving into nothingness and thereby encompassing 
everything, that we can truly embrace others. This is 
exemplified by strangers on the Silk Road greeting each other 
with a respectful '*pranam*', recognizing the underlying 
oneness and shared emptiness that connects us all.





Ashoka-Buddhism represents the first organized religion to 
achieve a breakthrough into true non-duality, and I make this 
assertion without being a Buddhist myself.




However, I discern echoes of Buddha's concept of emptiness in 
the double negations of my favorite mystic, Meister Eckhart. 
Listen here to what the Meister has to say:

*"Things are all made from nothing;

hence their true source is nothing."*

I could continue drawing parallels 
between Vedanta, Buddhism, and the teachings of Meister Eckhart. 
However, this is not the appropriate forum for an extensive 
comparison, so I will limit myself to a quote that aligns the 
Indian concept of *
['Neti, neti' – 
not this, not that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neti_neti)* – with one of Eckhart's many similar 
assertions:


"God is such that we apprehend him better by negation than by affirmation."

The following quote aptly 
delineates the distinction between consciousness, confined by 
the denial of being the other, and God, or consciousness as 
omnipresent in all and nothing:

"All
creatures contain one reflection:

one, that is the denial of its being
the other;

the highest of the angels denies he is the lowest.


God is the denial of denials."

The Meister and 
Luhmann

**Meister Eckhart also asserts:



"The tendency is ever towards self-repetition, 
**
towards the preservation of 
the species:

it is every man' s intention that his work should be himself."

Meister Eckhart


This statement brings to mind the in-depth systemic theories of
[Niklas 
Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann). In this context, I suggest incorporating 
consciousness as a crucial, albeit unseen, orchestrator of 
social systems, driven by their inherent intention to replicate 
themselves.





The Silent Systemic Power of Consciousness

**The concentric circles of consciousness are shared 
information fields that, as previously mentioned, transcend 
language. In a sense, they also transcend the host, the body 
itself.**


At this juncture, we venture into realms less charted by 
science, into territories closer to the unknown. I am reminded 
of [Bertrand Russell's analogy of the celestial teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot); if I 
assert that a teapot orbits the Earth, brimming with hot, 
delicious tea, it's not the responsibility of science to refute 
this claim, but mine to substantiate it.



Nonetheless, driven by my intuition, I am drawn to delve into 
this concept, fully acknowledging that this exploration 
resonates more with shamanic guidance than with scientific 
validation. Despite my appreciation for empirical and historical 
analysis, I do not confine myself to the traditional academic 
boundaries. I choose not to think and write within these 
systemic limits, which, in my view, often hinder truly 
innovative thinking in favor of a 'better safe than sorry' 
approach, constrained by the practicalities of everyday 
responsibilities like monthly mortgage payments.



The Power of the Silent Field

**The potency of shared fields of consciousness extends beyond 
the realm of Yuval Noah Harari's concept of the 'story-telling 
animal'.**


I have personally experienced this phenomenon in various 
settings, notably in group meditation. Similarly, in the gym, 
the collective energy and motivation enable me to lift weights 
that would be challenging to handle alone at home. This 
phenomenon is also evident in social media communities, where 
individuals converge around common interests or beliefs. From 
the compelling oratory of figures like Hitler to large rock 
concerts, and even among the numerous 'fake Gurus' that Sufi 
mystic
[
Shams of Tabrizi](https://sufipathoflove.com/forty-rules-of-love-of-shams-of-tabriz-1185-1248/) likened to the countless stars in the sky, there is 
an observable innate human yearning to surrender to something 
larger than oneself.



But how does this happen? It occurs through our sensory 
perception of body movements, even at a micro-level. We often 
subconsciously mirror the bodily expressions of those we 
identify with, leading to a synchronization similar to soldiers 
marching in unison.



Yet, there are additional forces at play. Social media, in its 
disembodied form, has shown how powerful fields of consciousness 
can emerge without physical imitation. My theory, which remains 
unsubstantiated, posits that this social cohesion, the temporary 
ecstasy of surrender, is not solely a result of storytelling or 
bodily synchronization. It seems to be an inherent quality of 
consciousness itself.



In my many experiences with group meditation, where participants 
sit silently with closed eyes, the presence of a profound 
collective spirit – which could be likened to the 'holy ghost' – 
is occasionally tangible, and at other times, it is not. This 
presence seems not to be tied to any particular set of 
conditions, apart from, perhaps, the purity of the hearts of 
those present. When this spirit is present, there is a shared, 
instantaneous recognition among everyone that everyone is aware 
of its presence.



This phenomenon I perceive as the cosmic glue is best described 
as love. However, this love must continually transcend itself 
into larger circles of consciousness to foster the creation of 
greater civilizations. Otherwise, it risks imploding under the 
sheer force of its own boundaries, constrained by defining 
itself against what lies outside.
