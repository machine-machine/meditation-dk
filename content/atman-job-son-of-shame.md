As mentioned like a mantra on Meditation.dk: 
Whatever I point at, is for you 
to verify in your own inner lab. Sit in silence, focus inward, and allow your 
attention to spiral gently into itself. Such explorations can lead to profound 
realizations. However, when you return from this inward journey and try to 
capture the experience in words, confusion often arises. You may search the 
knowledge bank of mystical experience for suitable language, only to find 
yourself entangled in conceptual contradictions.



A fundamental divergence in spiritual traditions lies at the heart of this 
chapter: Buddhist schools generally reject the notion of an individual soul, 
emphasizing instead the concept of
[*anatta* (non-self)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anattā), 
while Indian Vedantic and Christian traditions affirm a divine presence or 
‘entity’—whether as *[
ātman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ātman_(Hinduism))*, the eternal self, or the soul made in God's image.



Especially the Christian mystics are not so 
far from the Hindu saints. Meister Eckhart was scrutinized by 
the Inquisition for several of his teachings. One of the propositions attributed 
to him and later condemned by Pope John XXII in 1329 was: *"Whatever is true 
of divine nature is true of every being, and conversely, whatever is true of the 
nature of beings is true of the divine nature." *This statement reflects 
Eckhart's belief in the profound unity between God and creation, suggesting that 
the divine essence is present within all humans.



Personally, I find inspiration in the Vedantic and Christian perspectives—not 
because they offer definitive truths, but because they resonate more deeply with 
my direct experience. Despite their vast differences, both traditions recognize 
a reflection of the divine within the human being, portraying us as microcosmic 
expressions—*[‘monads’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology)*—of 
a greater cosmic intelligence.





But before we fall into endless debates about whether there is an essence, a soul, 
or a God, it is essential to recognize that language and concepts 
are often the true culprits of this confusion. Words inevitably fail when tasked 
with describing something fundamentally beyond language.




Therefore, I urge you to be brave enough to find your own concepts. Trust your 
experience and express it in a way that feels true to you—without leaning too 
heavily on established vocabulary. Let my writing inspire you, but do not follow 
it as your truth.



And when you *do* find your own language, keep it light. Let your words be 
signposts, not anchors. Let them point the way, but never mistake them for the 
experience itself. 



*Theologicans may quarrel, but the Mystics

of the world speak the same language.

PRIMORDIAL PAN-CONSIOUSNESS

**Let me now introduce my intuitive, fleeting, and 
experientially coined understanding of consciousness, guided by 
Occam's Razor. Please forgive any redundancy as I unfold this 
next layer. In explorations such as these, I favor what one 
might call a mantric writing style—a style that allows 
understanding to gently descend from the head into the body, 
transforming intellectual comprehension into embodied 
"innerstanding."**


A primordial pan-consciousness appears to permeate time and 
space. This ubiquitous consciousness is not dependent of 
biological life to arise but manifest as a shadow mirror of any 
structural matter. 

This simple first observing consciousness is what I refer to as 'God.' 
However, this God of the first order is not self-aware in the sense we typically 
imagine. It is a pure, pervasive awareness, present but not yet 
conscious of itself.




Let me offer a brief illustrative example. Have you 
ever woken up at night, suddenly realizing that you had been 
conscious during sleep, yet you were not aware of being 
conscious at the time? It is a peculiar kind of awareness—subtle 
and pervasive 'presentness', but without self-recognition.



If that seems abstract, consider this simpler analogy: Imagine a 
loud and persistant hum from a minibar fridge in a hotel room. You do not 
notice the sound at first, but when the fridge suddenly stops, 
you become instantly aware that you had been hearing it all 
along. The awareness was always present, but it had remained 
just [outside the reach of conscious recognition](/ouroboros/new-ouroboic-intelligence).




These examples point to a simple, primordial consciousness—one 
that is present yet unaware of itself. As an attempt to organize 
my own life experiences in a meaningful way, I postulate this 
consciousness as an omnipresent mirroring of all physical matter 
in space-time—a vast but dim light lacking self-awareness. It 
reflects everything that manifests as solid and structured, yet 
it remains blind to its own existence. In this sense it could be 
named dark light since it is not aware of its own shining.



This primordial consciousness is like a guest in our world. It 
is eternal, a locationless 
location—beyond time and space, a higher-dimensional being that 
transcends the constraints of our reality. Yet, when it 'enters' 
or rather, samples itself into the manifest world, it does not do so uniformly. Instead, it 
follows matter like a mirror-shadow, subtly concentrated and entwined with its 
unfolding presence.




As matter evolves into more complex structures, this 
space-time derived consciousness does not merely accompany it—it intensifies, both 
in 'quality' and 'quantity'. The greater the complexity, the more 
refined and concentrated its reflective capacity becomes. Seen 
in this perspective, primordial consciousness does not emerge from matter, 
but rather condenses and sharpens in parallel with its 
increasing structural intricacy.



No matter how intense or concentrated this primordial 
consciousness becomes, it still lacks the capacity to 
consciously aware 
itself. It reflects, it permeates, it mirrors existence—but it 
does not see itself. Like a vast cosmic eye that remains open 
yet blind to its own gaze, it exists as an unconscious 
illumination, present in all things yet unable to step outside 
itself to recognize its own presence.



As a quantum poet, I would dare to write: It is this primordial 
consciousness that collapses the wave-function into matter—or 
perhaps it is the other way around.




This
[pan-psychic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism) 
'God' is, at its primordial core, neither human nor of worldly 
nature. It interacts with space-time, yet it does so as an
[osmotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis) 
presence, a
[
visitor from a higher dimension](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia#A_CAT_FROM_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_)—one in which our reality is 
merely nested rather than ultimate. My deepest intuition, shaped 
by direct experience, suggests that this presence resides beyond 
cognition, beyond even what we conceive as existence itself—a 
dimension where being and non-being, presence and absence, 
dissolve into a singular, unfathomable ground.

In this higher realm, what we call 
‘God’—or, in Meister Eckhart’s terms, the *'Godhead'*—dwells 
in a darkness beyond time and space. This is not the 
anthropomorphic deity of religious doctrine but something far 
more elusive: a primordial aware presence that belongs to a 
layer of existence far removed from our familiar 
dimensions and hence also understandings.



Thus, we will never fully explain consciousness, for we remain 
bound by cognitive faculties shaped by time-space evolution—not for the 
purpose of grasping our own infinite origin, but for navigating 
the constraints of time and space. Our cognitive minds are designed for 
survival, not for unraveling the groundless ground of awareness 
itself.



It is, as Eckhart describes, the *
[
'Ground of the Soul'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_of_the_Soul)*—the silent, pre-conceptual mirror 
in which all that exists is reflected, the source from which 
even our cosmological constants emerge.



[
Pseudo-Dionysos](/western-mystics#Pseudo-Dionysius___345_-_407_) describes this foundational state as *
'Divine Darkness.'* Expanding upon this, I propose that when 
this transcendent darkness manifests within the dimensions of 
time and space, it transforms into *'Divine Light.'* In the 
state of divine darkness, there exists but a single observer. 
However, when expressed as divine light, this observer 
proliferates, resembling countless stars scattered across the 
night sky. Ultimately, though, there remains fundamentally only 
one observer, perceiving reality through every individual's 
eyes.



In summary, consciousness at it's core is not a 'thing'—not an object we can dissect or 
measure. It is a higher dimensional stage on which all things appear and 
interact, the backdrop against which reality unfolds. In its 
essence, consciousness is primordial, preceding and transcending 
all things that arise within it.

*'God is The
absolute No-thing

which is above all existence.'

* Pseudo-Dionysos


ATMAN: A SPACE-TIME COPY OF A 
HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL BRAHMAN

** 


In India, since ancient times the 
individual human soul has been called *
Atman*. The universal 'soul' or consciousness was termed *Brahman*. In 
this context it would give meaning to view Atman as a brain derived simulacra of 
the pan-consciousness existing prior to brains as focal lenses.
Pan-consciousness 
reflects



as closer to *
[ding an sich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself)* 
a foreign dimension where terms from time and space does not give any 
meaning.
In this 
context, I envision Atma-consciousness as a space-time mirror-copy of a visitor 
from another dimension, completely foreign to four-dimensional stage. Individual 
human 'made' consciousness can be compared to a soap bubble, whose thin and 
ultra-transient membrane reflects the sky.

**
*Atman in Brahman - Brahman in Atman*


Seen ontologically, biological life appears to 
carry an inherent impulse toward the formation of a soul—what Leibniz might call 
a monad, and what Kant would describe as a *'Ding für uns'*—a 
self-referential construct striving to approximate the other-worldly *'Ding an 
sich'.*

Now, let me set the stage for the next section with a simple yet 
profound question: Does a dog know that it is a dog? And what 
about humans? Is the infant below self-conscious?

![](/images/kailash1.jpg)





The first Loop: Being Conscious about Awareness

**The possibility of being conscious about being conscious is most probably a 
feature that only can evolve in grown-up humans and some of our primate 
relatives.


The child pictured above is conscious, but it is 
still not being conscious about being conscious. A trained meditator will often 
be conscious even in the phase of slow wave sleep. However, only when he wakes 
up into being conscious of being conscious he can have a glimpse of the fact that he was 
conscious all along. The meta-consciousness of being conscious will emerge 
gradualy as we grow up. A human being is, in this respect, a concentrated rabbit 
hole of self-awaring Consciousness. We are self conscious oases in the vast delicious dessert of primordial unconscious 
Consciousness.


What is the mirror of consciousness made of seen 
from the Atma level? It consists of neural feed back connections between brain 
cells. A mirror is a feed 
back mechanism.


**


![](/images/selfreflection.jpg)

**

**

IN MAN, 'GOD' BECOMES CONSCIOUSLY SELF-AWARE

**This profound state can manifest only within 
highly advanced and complex biological brain structures, capeable of 
self-referenial feed back circuits. Viewing Eckhart's 
teaching through this lens highlights his assertion:


*'The only difference between a saint and a fly**
is that the saint knows that he comes from God.'*


At its core, the intrinsic variability and 
individuality of consciousness stem from the human brain's sophisticated ability 
to enter and sustain an intensified state of self-referential awareness.



However, being shaped within the 
confines of time and space, the soul remains, and will always 
be, a simulacrum of the timeless and spaceless—a reflection, 
never the original, but ever reaching toward it.




This encapsulates the enigmatic nature of 
consciousness reenforced within spacetime: it simultaneously exists and does not exist. 
Within this paradoxical condition, consciousness mirrors
[Kant's notion of the 
*'thing-in-itself,*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself)*'* extending even beyond Kant’s original definition. It 
represents the primordial ground—a state transcending even the diffuse,
[omnipresent conception of God](/ouroboros/atman-job-son-of-shame).



Yet, in this simulacra reflectiveness Atman can be the experiental 
newtonian knower of Brahman in Atman. Atman
is in this sense, the imperfect human in the form of* *Job and from here he evolves into the 'innerstanding' son of God. 
As C.G. Jung points out, Jesus as a human representation of god 
is heralded by Job in his trials. In his patience towards the 
suffering created by god, he becomes greater than god and 
therefore god 'decides' to be man.



Looped Consciousness ****

**The real journey, at least for me as a complex, 
self-referential biological being, lies in the unique ability to 
become consciously aware of the primordial omni-consciousness. 
In my interpretation, this marks the first loop of 
self-conscious awareness—a moment that begins at dawn, when the 
first awakening realizes it has been awake all along.**



This journey began with the evolution of biological life capable 
of self-referentiality. In highly advanced mammals, the 
intricate organization of matter enables self-referential 
feedback loops, allowing consciousness itself to spiral into 
self-awareness. This biological roar of feedback has, by now, 
reached a temporary culmination in the human brain—a structure 
so complex that it can generate more possible neural 
information-combinations than there are particles in the known 
universe.




When the Looped Consciousness Discovers Itself 


**Now, let us read the following lines from Meister Eckhart with 
this perspective in mind—that the ‘God’ he speaks of could be 
understood as the first primordial consciousness:

*"I am certain **
as I live that nothing is so close to me as God.

God is nearer to me than I am to my own self;

my life depends upon God's
being near me,

present in me.



So is he also in a stone, a log of wood,

only they do not
know it.

If the wood knew of God and realized his nearness

like the highest of the
angels does,

then the log would be as blessed as the chief of all angels."*

Meister Eckhart


This is precisely the miracle unfolding in deep 
meditation. In the self-reflective feedback of introspection, awareness does not 
grasp this knowing intellectually—it does not "understand" in the cognitive 
sense, but rather "innerstands." In this state of direct recognition, we become 
blessed, as the Meister describes, not through faith or belief but through an 
undeniable, lived experience of divine presence.



It is in this spirit that C.G. Jung suggests Job, like the Nordic god Balder, is 
a forerunner of the Son of God. What, then, is Christ? He is the one in whom the 
dim, scattered light of primordial consciousness is gathered, magnified, and 
turned back upon its source—the moment when awareness fully beholds itself in 
consciousness:


*"From the moment when Christ's soul and body 
were united with the Godhead his soul has been gazing at the Godhead as it is 
doing to this day."

*Meister Eckhart


This is the return loop of consciousness, the 
moment when the mirror becomes consciously aware of itself, when the knower and 
the known dissolve into one seamless gaze. Here, with the Meisters words, *the 
knowing is the same as the knower himself.*



Job is Greater than God

**C.G. Jung posits that after
[
the trials of Job](/ouroboros/embodiment-of-ouroboros#The_Trial_in_the_Book_of_Job_and_Jungs_Notion_of_Individuation_), God was compelled to manifest as man. In this view, the 
Son of God represents nothing less than the weak yet omnipresent light of God, 
focused and intensified through the narrow pinhole of the complex, 
self-referential human brain. Through grateful acceptance of human suffering, the brain of Job becomes a magnifying glass, 
concentrating the otherwise dim divine light into something far more brilliant 
and distinct. **


In this vein, a human being can be seen as a reflection of God—yet, 
paradoxically, this reflection surpasses the original. Through the experience of 
human self-awareness, God achieves a higher, more concentrated realization of 
Himself through His 'Son'—a divine spark reflected and intensified in the mirror 
of human consciousness.




The Copy Surpasses the Original

**In contemporary times, many intellectual circles have entertained the notion 
that our reality might be a simulation. This concept is often interpreted as a 
simulacrum—a degraded copy of an original, a 'fall' from perfection. Such 
thinking echoes an ancient mythological theme that humanity has strayed from a 
primordial state of grace and must strive to return to it. This archetypal 
belief can be traced from the Indian concept of *
[Kali Yuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga)* to the story 
of Adam and Eve’s fall from Eden.**



However, I propose an alternative view—one that turns this notion upside-down. 
What if, rather than a fall, this reality represents a vital evolution? What if 
suffering and separation from perfection are not signs of decay but the birth 
pangs of something greater?



Here, in the crucible of suffering, something entirely new is born: the loop of 
knowing knowing knowing. This self-reflective awareness—where looped consciousness 
becomes aware of itself—is the miracle of human life. It is the very process 
through which God, through man, surpasses His original form.



Thus, rather than lamenting a lost perfection, we might celebrate this unfolding 
spiral of awareness as the birth of something far more profound: an infinite 
feedback loop of self-recognition, where the divine becomes more deeply and 
truly itself through each turn of conscious reflection. In this spirit I read 
the following quote:



*
God needs me as much as I need him.

*
Meister Eckhart




![](/images/Silesius2.jpg)

I know that without
me,

God cannot live an instant.

Angelus Silesius 1624–1677




FROM SHAME TO EGO-TRANSCENDENCE

**When I, as a young man in my early twenties, experienced my first 
groundbreaking spiritual awakening, I encountered ecstasy surpassing anything I 
had ever known. Yet, after some time, this blissful state gave way to a painful 
descent—perhaps what mystics describe as the *'dark night of the soul.'* In 
this new mirror, illuminated by new awareness, I became painfully conscious of 
the inner mental darkness within me.**


A pivotal moment in human evolution—and indeed, in the very unfolding of 
consciousness itself—occurs when self-reflective awareness first perceives 
itself within the human mirror-brain.



However, during this initial awakening of self-consciousness, humanity did not 
immediately perceive consciousness in its pure, concentrated form—a state more 
profound than even the concept of God. Instead, like Adam and Eve, the initial 
realization was not one of boundless, infinite awareness, but rather one of 
limitation. They became conscious of their fragility, their separateness, their 
inherent vulnerability.




The French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre famously stated that humans are 
*'condemned to self-consciousness.'* His insight captures the existential burden 
of self-evaluation—the relentless awareness of being both actor and audience in 
the theater of one’s own existence. Sartre stated: *'Shame is the recognition 
of the fact that I am indeed that object which the Other is looking at and 
judging.'*



In this light, Sartre’s notion of self-consciousness can be seen as a modern 
echo of the biblical story of Adam and Eve. Their shame upon realizing their 
nakedness symbolizes the moment consciousness became aware of itself—not as an 
expansive state, but through the lens of judgment and self-reflection. Their 
gaze, once turned outward, suddenly turned inward, but instead of seeing 
infinite awareness, it saw limitation.



At its core, shame is the experience of seeing oneself from the outside in. The 
birth of looped conscious self-awareness was also the birth of 
self-doubt—alongside the shocking realization that *'I exist' *is 
inseparable from *'One day, I will cease to exist.'*



The mirror had turned against the mirror but could not yet see itself 
clearly—clouded by the distortions of egoic subjectivity. At first, it was 
merely a human seeing its own reflection, not yet a mirror reflecting a mirror, 
reflecting a mirror.



This is, in fact, one of the main obstacles for on our human journey as 
unfolders of looped consiousness. We cannot bear the sight of ourselves - especially 
within the confines of our old ego-reality torn between virtue, shame and sin.



![](/images/neo.jpg)




The Birth Pain of Awakening to Oneself

**A fitting analogy is Neo's awakening from the illusory
[Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix). The moment of 
first encountering a higher level of looped consciousness is a triumphant 
revelation but often also accompanied by a deep existential shock. Like Neo, the 
one who glimpses beyond the veil of conditioned reality experiences a 
disorienting shift, where the world that once felt meaningful now appears 
unreal.**


Daily conversations with friends and family, once engaging, may suddenly seem 
superficial—full of half-truths, unconscious scripts, and small, socially 
acceptable lies. The very fabric of one’s previous understanding begins to 
unravel, leaving a stark awareness of the disconnect between deeper reality and 
the world most people continue to accept unquestioningly.



It is no wonder that [Cypher](https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Cypher) justifies his decision to betray his companions and 
re-enter the Matrix, seeking refuge in comfortable illusion:


*"You know… I know this steak doesn't exist. I 
know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is 
juicy and delicious. After nine years… you know what I’ve realized? Ignorance is 
bliss."*


Self-consciousness, can, at first, be experienced 
as a fall—an 
unbearable weight of shame and limitation, as Sartre and the Genesis myth both 
illustrate. But in Job, we see the next stage: suffering refines 
self-consciousness until it becomes a mirror capable of reflecting the divine 
itself. This is why Jung sees Job as the necessary forerunner to 
Christ—consciousness must endure its own weight before it can become light.



The Dissolution of the Old Self

**The awakening of self-consciousness begins as a powerful transformation—an 
ecstatic yet painful process. Initially, there is ecstasy, swiftly followed by 
the difficult descent into what mystics call "the dark night of the soul." This 
experience represents far more than personal struggle; it signals the collapse 
of an entire mode of existing.**


With the birth of true self-awareness, the rigid structures of the ego gradually 
dissolve. The mirror, previously clouded by conditioned thoughts, judgments, and 
limitations, begins to clear. The restless, outward-directed mind is gently 
guided inward through meditation, creating space for a deeper and truer 
reflection to emerge, free from existential distortion.



Through this inward turning, the once obscure mirror is revealed in its pristine 
clarity—no longer merely reflecting our external persona, but reflecting 
consciousness itself. What began as an uncomfortable confrontation with inner 
darkness gradually transforms into liberation, a profound sense of freedom 
emerging from saying farewell to Sartre's world and the confines of an old way 
of being.



When you close your eyes and ask yourself, *Who am I?*, the 
[knowing of not-knowing](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia#Embracing_the_Unknown) 
intensifies. Hence, the sense of bewilderment arises as the *'I'* asking the 
question dissolves through the very act of questioning.



Here lies a profound paradox:

The very entity that sees itself trapped in guilt, shame, and the compulsion to 
constantly apologize disappears through the act of looking.



The guilt dissolves 
together with the guilty.



This process is in the beginning often marked by sudden leaps— later it 
progresses in small, almost 
imperceptible steps. Yet, as long as they move in the same direction, they 
accumulate, shaping an entirely new way of being as the years pass.



As St. Dionysius described it, consciousness—or God—is *'a fountain flowing 
into itself.'* The self-awareness of looped consciousness is not a static entity but a dynamic, recursive 
unfolding—an endless return to the source.


In summary, this shift is not easy, as the human mind 
is primarily evolved to focus on the external world through the five senses. Our subjective 
conscious *'I' *is not 
naturally programmed to look at itself, to observe its own inner workings. 
Therefore, exploring the depths of consciousness requires utmost sincerity and 
vigilance. We must commit ourselves to the task of inward exploration, even when 
it is difficult, and when we are met with resistance from our own minds.


*There are all too few who are fully ripe

for 
gazing in God's magic mirror.

*Meister Eckhart




Who Am ‘I’?

**We now stand, like a small universe folding into itself, at the threshold of 
an endless journey into bewilderment.**
**Every 
step taken deeper reveals yet another veil, another hidden layer—a mystery 
behind the mystery. It is as if the very [act of 
self-inquiry](Who_am_I.htm) does not resolve questions but instead deepens them, dissolving 
certainty into a vast and luminous unknown.**


Yet, paradoxically, it is within this very bewilderment that something 
extraordinary can occur. When curiosity, so naturally directed outward, turns 
inward upon itself, it ignites a self-reflective process that may open the door 
to expanded states of consciousness.



As we spiral inward, self-recognition moves beyond concepts and into direct 
experience. This is no longer about understanding who we are—it is about 
becoming the knowing itself.



The Indian saint Ramana Maharshi urged seekers to pursue the question, *
['Who am I?'](Who_am_I.htm)* 
Nisargadatta Maharaj pointed to *'I am'* as the gateway to realization. Gurdjieff 
spoke of *'constant self-remembrance'*, while Meister Eckhart described this inward 
turning as an encounter with the *'Godhead'* or the *'primordial gorund'*. Though framed in different languages and 
traditions, the essence of their teachings converges on the same insight: a 
recognition of the consiously looped self as something more fundamental than the personality, more 
essential than thought.




In looking for yourself, you dissappear - and so does your understanding

**Meister Eckhart suggests that to see God, we must 
become blind. This may seem paradoxical, but it points to the fact that the ego 
cannot look at itself without spiraling into annihilation.
When we direct our attention inward, 
an unknown something observes itself. This activates an infinity function 
where
the 
solid conscious observer instantly melts into fluidity, so that the one asking, 
*[Who am I?](Who_am_I.htm)*, ceases to exist. We are only our 'I' as long as we look away from 
ourselves. Consequently, we vanish each time we try to catch ourselves directly, 
and without a subject capable of understanding, understanding becomes 
meaningless.
Not knowing is in this sense wisdom as opposed to knowing which creates 
knowledge. 


*When Awareness is directed against itself,

a feeling of not knowing is created.

When Awareness is going out,

knowledge is created.

*Nisargadatta Maharaj


Now what happens after such an introspection? Then we, like a rubber 
band, snap back to our normal equilibrium of being a solidified 'I'. However, this 
new 'I' is 
slightly different from the older one that just one second ago tried to get a glimpse of itself. As we know 
from quantum physics, we cannot observe anything without changing it. We cannot 
even remember something without changing our memory of it. Therefore, the 
disappearance of 'I' during introspective self-examination creates a spiraled 
transformation, where a new 'I' contineously replaces the old 'I'. The relay of 
'Who am I?' 
is now in the hands of the next 'I' in the race towards a black hole of 
continuous death and rebirth, but on a scale so subtle, that we might not even 
recognize it.

*How to see God?

To see Him is to be consumed by Him
*
Ramana Maharshi


In summary, ego cannot look at itself in God's magic mirror, 
without spiralling into anihilation. However, pure consciousness in its 
looped brain derived essence can do so and even thrive. In the micro ego-death of self enquiry, a 
more intense human atma-consciousness is born. The strange and wonderful thing is that as 
the not-understanding and dissolution of solidified subjectivity intensifies 
during this inner investigation, so does the abstract human consciousness experiencing it. 
Through the loophole of increasing curiosity-driven not-knowing, our consciousness expands 
in both 'quality' and 'quantity'. 


This is what Meditation is all about: to make Atma-consciousness aware of 
Brahma-consciousness in an expanding self-referential loop with the potential capacity 
to end in a singular state of explosive conscious not-understanding and 
disolving.
In this context, the following statement from Meister Eckhart gives 'sense':


In unknowing knowing shall we 
know God.


Eckhart rarely uses the the term consciousness. 
Among the Western mystics, the singular state of consciousness has been termed 
'God'. God is in my view nothing but a projective concept of a rare state of 
being within man's own event horizon. God abides in a concentrated form in the 
complexity of the human brain as looped consciousnes.

God is greater than God

Meister Eckhart


In the next chapter, 



[Ouroboros Consciousness](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness), 

we will look 
closer into what happens to consciousness when it bites in its own tail.
