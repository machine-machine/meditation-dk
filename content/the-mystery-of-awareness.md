THE MYSTERY OF AWARENESS**






*Oh Friend! Understand**The body is like the ocean
Rich with hidden treasures.
*

Mirabai



During my time in India, I chanced upon an
[intriguing individual](rebellious_meditation_master.htm) in a 
nondescript town called Hoshiarpur. This enigmatic figure sat in a dimly lit room, exuding mild 
annoyance at the occasional visitor who mustered the courage to knock. After a 
prolonged silence, he shared, "*When I visit the toilet, God does too*." 
Drawing me closer, he fixed his semi-blind gaze upon me, posing a question: "*Do 
you recognize which sense organ is supremely vital, yet often overlooked?*" 
He then revealed: 


*It's the skin*.

SKIN SENSING AND CELL MEMBRANES****
What is the oldest operating system in the human organism? Which sense first 
emerged from the ancient cellular organisms' evolutionary tree? My guess is that 
attentive skin sensing is, from an evolutionary biology standpoint, our oldest 
sense. Skin sensing is the most fundamental aspect of humans' interaction with 
the outside world.
These ancient systems can be 
likened to the tactile properties of a cell membrane, which 
senses its immediate environment much like our skin senses 
touch.




A crucial characteristic of the deepest layer of the control 
system of awareness is the fundamental closeness that existed from the cell nucleus to the 
cell wall. Sensations of touch still carry this survival experience from their 
meeting with the ocean in their basic programming. As a result, the 
symbiotically sensing cell walls of human skin are, in all their superficiality, 
closest to our "soul core."





Cells in the primordial ocean did not see, hear, or smell 
anything, even after they formed the first types of symbiotic 
life. These cells did not see the sunlight, but they noticed the 
warmth from it in the form of 
close-sensed information from their cell walls. They sensed the world, and 
through responses to this sensing, they survived. The older a biological 
survival system is, the more it will be anchored in unmediated bodily close 
sensing.




Carried along from the cellular experince in the precambric 
ocean there is one fundamental message: 

Everything that makes 'me' survive feels 'good'.

Everything that threatens my survival is sensed 'evil'.



The Ancient Sense of Touch

**If a cell could understand and speak words, it would recognize the description 
of skin's sense of touch and might say: that's precisely how it feels out by my 
cell walls' protective ramparts! These single cells were small fortresses with 
protective walls around them, protecting even older forms of life, such as 
mitochondria. When these cells joined together in symbiotic alliances through an 
outer ring of sensory defense, they developed the beginnings of the extended 
hard skin that, through aeonic time in struggle, enabled them to survive as 
'me'.**


This type of close-range sensing is primarily related to the 
precambrian primal cells' defense against annihilation: the 
fortified cell wall. Later, when cells discovered how to join 
together in symbiotic alliances, they carried this earliest 
genetic memory with them and, based on it, created a common 
'cosmotic' defense against chaos in the form of skin. In this 
sense, cells' osmotic membranes are the recycled ramparts of 
awareness from our original primordial 
home. From their biological palisades, skin sensing systems have defended 
pre-human and later human cell federations against attacks for billions of 
years.



The closer a threat comes to the body, the stronger the 
survival response will be.
Skin sensing is in this sense more closely tied to the eternal question of 
survival: death... or life? Even very primitive animals possess 
a sense of touch. Poke a worm with a sharp stick and observe it. 
Then (gently) poke a human and observe the reaction. Both reactions are 
about simple survival. Above all, we have been aware to 
survive.


From the simplest earthworm to complex humans, the skin stands out as the 
body's most expansive sensory organ. While most senses are localized—eyes 
dedicated to vision, ears to sound—the skin is a universal sheath that covers 
every inch of us. The wise sage from Hoshiarpur put it aptly: "*We are encased in 
a continuous stretch of skin from crown to sole*." Beyond merely serving as a 
protective barrier, the skin is a dynamic medium, bursting with millions of 
nerve endings. These nerves translate myriad sensations, from the gentle caress 
of a breeze to the sting of a winter's chill, from the comfort of warmth to the 
distress of pain. In a metaphorical sense, the cell membrane, often dubbed the 
"first skin" of organisms, mirrors how our skin constantly interacts with the 
external environment.




THE AWARE SK-INSIDE





*A human being has so many skins inside,


covering the depths of the heart.

We know so many things,

but we don't know ourselves!



Why, thirty or forty skins or hides,

as thick and hard as an ox's or bear's,

cover the soul.

Go into your own ground

and learn to know yourself there.

*

[Meister Eckhart](http://www.op.org/eckhart/meister.htm)




The 'foretold' language

**Our tenure as linguistic beings in the 
realm of waking consciousness is but a brief flicker, akin to a fleeting moment 
just before the stroke of midnight. Undoubtedly, 'The Word' wasn't present at 
the outset. It made its entrance much later. The vast expanse of our 
evolutionary journey was traversed in states of inanimate silence akin to inert 
stones, in dreamlike contemplations reminiscent of plants, and in exuberant 
vocalizations evocative of zealous monkeys.**


Taste, smell, tactile 
sensations, and emotional perceptions are as our close-up senses 
evolutionarily older than sight and sound. Hence they inherently 
pose a challenge for us as conscious beings. Newertheless we 
have since the birth of the first words, tried the impossible 
task to understand 
these older ancestors still living in us.



Yet, in their relatively brief existence, words often possess wisdom that seems 
to elude those who utter them. At times, within the fabric of language lie 
dormant truths—truths so elementary and pure that we might not articulate them 
directly but can only allude to or 'foretell'.



The Skin: A Living 
Canvas of Our Sensations and Emotions** 
**
The skin is more than an extroverted sensory receptor; it's an emotional barometer. While 
it notifies us of a mosquito's prick or the brush of a feather, it also becomes 
an internal canvas upon which emotions like love, anxiety, or embarrassment are 
painted. Our skin is a bridge, connecting our tangible exterior with our 
intangible interior. Indeed, we 'sense' the internal workings of our body much 
in the same way we perceive our skin's interactions with the outside world. Our 
consciousness is like a pendulum, swaying between external stimuli and internal 
sensations, all regulated and narrated by the ever-sensitive, ever-responsive 
skin.



We see this confluence of the external and 
internal in the lexicon we use to describe our experiences. Just as our skin can 
be irritated, so can our temperament. Blushing exemplifies this synergy, linking 
strong internal emotions to visible skin responses. 




Consider the nuances behind this commonplace query: "*Do you 'feel' 
comfortable?*" Our core existence is intrinsically bound to feelings. To 
exist is, above all, an act of feeling—a tactile experience spanning from the 
outer layer of our skin to the deepest caverns of our internal realm.



Narratives of the Introverted Skin: Linguistic Alchemy****
Our language is rich with terms that metamorphose from the tactile to the 
emotional, co-opting the vocabulary of skin sensation to describe our internal 
states. These phrases—like feeling "touched," "weighed down," or "squeezed"—are 
more than just idiomatic expressions; they are testament to our conscious mind's 
thoughtful interpretation of bodily sensations. Terms like "thin-skinned" and 
"thick-skinned" eloquently express varying degrees of emotional sensitivity. 
Similarly, experiences or people can "get under our skin," or we may "wear our 
hearts on our sleeves." We express raw emotion in the terms of raw skin: Physical abrasions 
that make skin raw becomes a metaphor to the rawness of 
emotional upheaval. A seamless skin texture echoes life's smoother 
phases. Here we say, my life is 'smooth as silk' or it is all 'smooth sailing.'




Such examples unveil the multifaceted nature of language, where words evolve 
from tactile origins to encapsulate emotional nuances. It's also noteworthy that 
many, but not all, touch-derived idioms derive from a context of perceived 
threat or harm. Even the threat of being bitten has survived in the form of the 
biting chill that can pierce our skin. Grief can pierce our hearts. As we can 
get wounded, so can our emotions.


In our contemporary 
civilized world, direct physical confrontations have become more rare as 
compared to 10.000 years ago. However, we are still to some extend stone-age 
apes behind the suit and tie. In this new scenario subtle agressions or 
micro-agression have become a new way to show dominance.

As a consequence of that shift, imagery of pinpricks or needles have become 
metaphorically powerful, symbolizing subtle emotional wounds inflicted on 
others. Here are some examples of skin-derived metaphors we use to describe hurt 
feelings.



Death by a Thousand Cuts: This ancient punishment, which involved administering 
many small wounds, has come to symbolize the idea that many small hurts can 
accumulate to create significant harm. When applied to emotional contexts, it 
can refer to the cumulative damage from ongoing, minor negative comments or 
actions.



Needling Someone: The phrase "to needle someone" means to intentionally irritate 
or provoke them, similar to the slight but persistent annoyance a small needle 
can cause.



Pinprick Attacks: This term can be used to describe subtle, but consistent, 
gaslightning criticisms or passive-aggressive comments that wear someone down over time.



Walking on Pins and Needles: While the more common phrase is "walking on 
eggshells," this variant emphasizes the painful anxiety of trying to avoid 
provoking someone or fearing retribution.



Feeling Every Pinch: It can describe someone who is sensitive to criticism or 
negative comments, even if they are minor.



Like a Thorn in My Side: While this uses the imagery of a thorn rather than a 
needle, it conveys a similar idea. It speaks of a persistent irritant or source 
of pain.



Interestingly these pinprick skin attacks, due to their subtleness pass under 
the radar of the conscious mind. Often we are not even consious about the attack 
when it is happening. However, the next days we feel that our emotional 
skin-borders have been crossed.



On the opposite end of the spectrum are the gentle sensations of soft caresses 
or embracing hugs. The sting of a slight is quite distinct from the warmth of 
being emotionally touched by someone. 




The Theory of 
Organ-Specific Awareness Systems

**It's intriguing to consider that our internal organs may possess a kind of 
self-awareness reminiscent of tactile sensations. Just as the heart might 
flutter with the excitement of an upcoming joyous event—mimicking the sensation 
of skin tingling in anticipation—each organ might operate as a unique system of 
awareness, each with its own sensory logic and protective barriers.
[Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann)'s 
writings on system theory in the context of societal structures intriguingly 
mirror this concept when we apply it to the body: envisioning it as a composite 
of individual organ awareness systems.**


Consider the heart, for instance. Faced with profound beauty—whether a 
magnificent panorama or a soul-stirring melody—the heart might race, trying to 
match the emotional depth of our experience. Such moments can manifest as 
emotional harmonies deep within us. When forging a deep bond with another, our 
hearts may feel in sync, akin to tuning forks vibrating at identical 
frequencies, creating a shared pulse of comprehension. In the presence of 
overwhelming beauty, the heart might feel expansive, reflecting our own profound 
awe. This sensation can resonate with the adjacent lungs. Despite their primary 
physiological differences, the heart and lungs share both anatomical proximity 
and intertwined emotional reactions. For instance, just as the lungs exhale a 
sigh to express relief or grief, the heart, too, sends out its silent emotional 
echoes, mirroring our most profound sentiments. Such metaphors beautifully 
depict the synchronized dance of organ sensation. While it's beyond our scope to 
delve into every organ's emotional tapestry, we must nod to the gut, our "second 
brain" responsible for gut feelings, which arise from its vast sensory surfaces. 
These sensations are registered in layer upon layer of the wast surface of the 
inner skin of tubular elongated digestions systems. Intriguingly, organs less 
shielded by bone, like the stomach, seem more attuned to feelings compared to 
the brain, ensconced within the skull.



The Aware Interoceptive Skin

**In summary, human awareness is first and foremost, being finely attuned 
through the skin as a sensory canvas that seamlessly blends external and 
internal sensations. Despite its 
prominence in shaping our awareness from the very onset of life, it's a narrative often relegated to the 
background by our waking consciousness. Strikingly, we allow our skin to narrate 
its loud stories in silence.**


You might wonder about the origin of these insights and their scientific 
validation. While they aren't currently backed by established research, they 
emerged from my personal introspection and meditation. I'd encourage you to 
embark on a similar introspective journey.



Bridging Consciousness and 
Awareness with language****
Our linguistic evolution represents 
a transformative endeavor to articulate awareness into consciousness. 
Discussing, reflecting upon, and coining terminology for sensory perceptions can 
aid in molding these intuitions into distinct thoughts. Such contemplation 
epitomizes an attempt to harness our instinctual internal responses via 
comprehension. By understanding cognitively, we've managed to sidestep both 
internal and external adversities.




The Multifaceted 'I'

**Our understanding of "self" is multi-layered, perhaps best envisioned as a 
collective of distinct bio-entities. These individual entities might not be 
conscious of each other's existence or understand each other's modalities. While 
these myriad forms of non-verbal communication are abundant within us, they 
converge in the brain—a forum where they can unify. Recognizing and 
acknowledging these bio-entities in our conscious mind is pivotal. Thus far, our 
predominant shared language has been verbal. Meditation, however, offers a new 
horizon.**


A central mission of Meditation.dk is to unveil a novel system, one capable of 
supervising—and at times superseding—the existing language-driven cognitive 
system. We've named this non-verbal system the "[Ouroboric Super-Awareness](/ouroboros/embodiment-of-ouroboros)" 
But for a holistic understanding, I'd recommend perusing all preliminary 
chapters first.










EPILOGUE:
SOME LOFTY THOUGHTS ON THE FUNDAMENTAL UNUNDERSTANDABILITY OF 
AWARENESS**


*All are seeing God always. But they 
don't know it.**
*Ramana Maharshi.





We are neck-deep in our body's sensed attention.

And we are not aware of it... It's simply mind-blowing!

How is it possible to be so aware and yet not conscious about it?



The Indian mystic Kabir says he laughs when he hears that the fish in the sea 
are thirsty for water. The sensing body's overwhelming and vital presence is to 
consciousness like the air we breathe. We take it for granted until the moment 
it becomes inaccessible.



The roaring world of awarenes is incomprehensibly simple and obvious. It is the dark 
matter in our galactic microcosm. The greatest mystery is that we are not 
conscious of awareness. We do to the largest extend possible not know ourselves.




Attention beyond Words




*An enormous part of our mature experience 
cannot be expressed in words.*

Alfred North Whitehead




In a way, Wittgenstein was right when he said: *
Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent. (*Tractatus 
Logico-Philosophicus)

There is nothing beyond language. At least that's how it appears to the 
linguistic consciousness itself. The paradox is that even though the simply 
sensed existence of attention is overwhelmingly fundamental, our intellectual 
minds float around like disembodied consciousness tiny balloons filled with word gas. 
Our Talking Heads are not aware of the extent to which they have grown out of 
the body's cellular sensory realm.

A SLEEPING GOD, BURRIED IN SKIN

**As I hinted at earlier, the aim was to 
spotlight the omnipresent yet largely unconscious sensations 
experienced through our skin as a hidden sanctuary for 
humanity's most ethereal construct: *GOD.*



Here, my intent is not to suggest that the concept of God is as 
superficial as our skin but to emphasize that the poetic 
metaphors used by Meister Eckhart in describing God serve as 
signposts to a concealed gateway to the cosmos. This portal does 
not sidestep our human sensations and emotions in its 
transcendence; rather, it traverses them, guided by the focused 
light of conscious awareness in the hands of those willing to 
embark on an inward journey.

When such introspection turned the evolutionary family tree 
upside down, the following revelation unfolded: As sensing 
systems, we are both expansive interfaces and enclosed storage 
spaces for a colony of cells working together. The skin's 
tactile surface is the line of control. It has clothed the inner 
collective world with a protective, yet osmotic boundary that 
defines it in relation to an outer world.



The operational reality of attention unfolds as an eternal 
negotiated process, created at a crossroads where humans, seen 
as an inner universe, navigate for survival in an outer 
universe.



The undiscovered by consciousness, but infinitely massive 
micro-life is 'GOD'. No image in the outer world resembles this 
dark cellular life of God more than the sight of the universe's 
stellar smile on a starry night.



We are a cellular alliance connected via the sensory tunnel 
bridge from a cellular microcosm to a galactic macrocosm. Just 
as inner and outer sensing share language, the inner cellular 
world and the outer star world share the same mathematical 
algorithms. Everything consists of recycling the same sacred 
mathematical truths that repeat themselves from the infinitely 
large to the infinitely small.

*As above, so below, as within, 
so without,

as the universe, so the soul.

*Hermes Trismegistus




The insights garnered from these explorations will be elaborated 
upon in the forthcoming chapters.


*In unknowing knowing shall we know God.

*Meister Eckhart



As we 
will see in the later chapters, 
Meditation opens a door where we to a great extend can both by-pass words and 
coin new words in the 
transmutation of awareness into consciousness.
