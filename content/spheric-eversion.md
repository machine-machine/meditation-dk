THE SPHERIC 
EVERSION OF THE SOUL****
*A House Made of Cake, Holding Cookies, Made of the House***

Meister Eckhart once stated: 


*'The body is much rather in the 
soul than the soul is in the body.'*




The Meister's profound statement, 
invites contemplation on the expansive nature of consciousness. 
Now let me in the spirit of the last paragraph deconstruct our 
usual notion of an expanding consciousness. Normally we describe 
altered states of consciousness as an expansive process. As 
described in the eight classical siddhis this experience takes 
the form of [*'*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhi)*[Mahimā,'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhi)* 
the ability to expand one's body to an infinitely large size.
**


To describe intensified states of self-consciousness as an 
expanding process is, however, a projection that leans too 
heavily on Newtonian vocabulary—a framework designed to capture 
the mechanics of the external world. Our language, shaped by the 
need to describe objects, movement, and measurable phenomena, 
often falters when tasked with articulating the ineffable 
dimensions of inner experience. What I mean to say is that this 
'expansion' is not linear like a drop of oil on the surface of 
water.




Consider the phrase '*he was beside himself with happiness*.' 
This expression vividly illustrates a condition in which an 
individual's joy is so intense that it transcends their usual 
self-constraints. In the context of 'sphere eversion,' this 
analogy becomes even more poignant. The individual's elation 
metaphorically everts, turning inward delight outward in an 
unbroken continuum. In this sense, we could describe the 
expansion as an 'innerspansion'.



At first, we may perceive this vast sanctuary as something 
contained within the body. But as consciousness continues its 
recursive, self-reflective loop—approaching what could be called 
a [self-referential singularity](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness)—the relationship inverts. 
Suddenly, the body is no longer the container; it is revealed as 
a minuscule droplet suspended within an ocean of boundless 
awareness.



This leads us to a pivotal realization: as consciousness spirals 
inward toward its own source, the 'space' it inhabits 
'innerspands' 
beyond measure. At a certain threshold—a point of no 
return—there is a profound reversal, an eversion of perspective. 
It is here that Meister Eckhart’s words ring true: *'The body 
is much more in the soul than the soul is in the body.'



*The Eversion of the Sphere

**In states of deep intense meditation, the boundaries that 
typically delineate the self from the external milieu begin to 
dissolve. Our innermost consciousness, which is generally 
perceived as residing within, suddenly flips 
outward, surpassing the physical limitations, thereby inverting 
our very bodily essence. In this expanded state, the 'self' is not 
confined to the body but extends into the surroundings, 
dissolving the separation between 'me' and 'not me.'**


This transcendental insight is akin to a metaphysical '*[sphere 
eversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_eversion)*,' a term borrowed from mathematics to describe 
the turning of a sphere inside out
[
without creasing or tearing it](https://youtu.be/iynrV-3I9CY?si=04IvAk0c-iqEvhWX). When such an eversion takes 
place the world is not longer outside you, but inside. What is 
inside is now also outside and vice versa.

Imagine a 
tennis ball suddenly turning inside out. I remember the first 
time I felt like I was that tennis ball. In a heartbeat, my entire perception 
shifted, and my body became this tiny little speck in an endless 
expanse of space.



This was not just 'mood making' with poetic metaphors but an 
experiential truth. The body, once perceived as the vessel of 
consciousness, was now seen 
as something cradled within an infinite field of conscious awareness. The 
container has become the contained as the sphere's inner surface 
emerged as its exterior.




It's mindbogling to think about, but it's 
true as a subjective experience: the way in leads out. This journey takes you from the 
meditation lounge to a limitless eversive expanse beyond anything you could have ever imagined.




[
Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel) posits in his dialectical theories that a quantitative 
alteration, given enough time and intensity, inevitably leads to 
a qualitative transformation. This idea can be applied to the 
concept of conscious inversion. Specifically, it suggests 
that a significant increase in the intensity of self-reflection 
and introspection can catalyze this qualitative shift in 
consciousness. This transformation marks a pivotal change in how 
an individual perceives and interacts with their internal and 
external realities.




The spatial shift 
happens as a consequence of the ouroboric feedback in consciousness. 
In the self-referential loop the internal becomes external and 
the external becomes internal. As with the sphere's eversion, 
the meditator's internal consciousness now unfurls, first intermingling 
with the environment and then the cosmos.



This unity transcends our ususal notions of duality and 
non-duality. It obliterates the 
binary of 'self' and 'other,' broadening one's identity to 
embrace the entire universe, not in an expansive movement but in 
an eversive inside out transformation.
As there is an eternal beginning in no beginning and an eternal 
end in no end, as there is existence in no existence, there is 
inside in outside and outside in inside. I have become the 
outside, and the outside has become my inside.



And in that revelation, space itself is no longer just a 
backdrop for experience—it is the experience as well as the 
experiencer in an inside that has become outside. I read the 
following quote from the Meister in this light:


God's exit is his entrance.
He broke in to let us out.

Eversive Love - When 
Self Interest** **
becomes Altruism****


![](/images/eversion.jpg)




An experience of a true 
spheric eversive consciousness can be identified by one 
thing only: It is a state of self centered love, a reality where everything is 
glued together from the inside by love. 
A genuine spheric eversion leads to a unified state where your 
self centered 'egoism' transcends itself and becomes 'altruism' 
from within. In this state you are everybody's egoic inside with 
the very same egoic drive for survival. In this eversive sense 
we are all sitting inside each others as small self-protective 
egoic entitites.





In summary, a state of deep meditative conscious attention, the 
sensations and feelings you experience are all contained within inner space: various phenomena arise and dissolve, seemingly 
unfolding within a familiar three-dimensional framework. 
However, as your focus spirals inward, the very fabric of this 
cathedral of awe begins to morph, transcending the 
confines of conventional logic and spatial understanding.



In the medieval period, scholastic philosophers—much to the 
ridicule of scientists during the later Enlightenment—wrote 
lengthy treatises speculating on how many
[
angels could fit on the tip of a needle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_many_angels_can_dance_on_the_head_of_a_pin?). Perhaps, however, 
they were onto something with their lofty deliberations. In 
their own way, they were gazing inward, eversive projecting outward, 
attempting to describe consciousness as a spaceless space—a 
locationless location—that could indeed fit on the tip of a 
needle or be a multi location, simultaneously conscious of 
[a 
thousand drops of Pepsi in a split second](#from_somewhere_this_pepsi_can). What I mean to suggest is this: both entanglement and 
superposition occur within a space without distance. In such a 
dimension there is truly no separation.



The Ourobororos

**The miracle of this spatial transformation mirrors the ancient 
symbol of the Ouroboros—the self-devouring snake, eternally 
feeding on its own tail. As we discussed in the chapter
[Ouroboros Consciousness](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness), 
this is not just a metaphor but an 
experiential reality: as senses within the realm of raw 
awareness merge with the expansive field of self-referential 
consciousness, a profound shift occurs. The boundaries between 
subject and object, observer and observed, begin to dissolve and 
with this our cosy Newtonian world.**



At the heart of this spiraling inward motion lies what could be 
called a singularity—a point where all distinctions collapse. 
Here, even light and sound, the fundamental signals of 
perception, vanish into the void of pure, unfathomable 
nothingness. And yet, paradoxically, this nothingness is not 
empty. It is full—radiantly, silently full. It is the groundless 
ground of being, the eternal presence that was always there, 
unnoticed beneath the layers of experience.



The ultimate paradox reveals itself: It unfolds only in the 
moment consciousness folds back into itself, realizing that it 
has never been separate from what it observes. And yet, in the 
same breath, it has always been here—unchanging, untouched.




A House Made of Cake, Holding 
Cookies, Made of the House

**Recently,** **I went to buy a larger amount of luxury 
cookies for my little son's birthday. My choise fell on a pastry 
shop called [*'The Cake 
House*.'](https://lagkagehuset.dk/) Suddenly I realized that this was, in fact, the 
ideal metaphor for the Spheric inversion of the Soul: 
Imagine a house made entirely of cake. It contains cookies—each 
cookie made of the same substance as the house itself. This 
recursive image captures the essence of spheric eversion: a 
paradox where container and content, inner and outer, self and 
world, fold into each other so deeply that the boundary 
dissolves. **


In the same way, consciousness appears at first to reside inside 
the body, much like cookies inside a cake house. But through 
deep meditation and self-reflection, the perspective inverts: 
the body is revealed as a small feature within the vast field of 
awareness—a cookie inside a much larger cake it thought it 
contained.



This process, called spheric eversion, is not linear expansion 
but innerspansion: a self-referential turning-inside-out of 
experience. Like the mathematical eversion of a sphere, what was 
once inside becomes outside, and vice versa.



Just as the cake and cookie are made of the same dough, so too 
is the ego and the cosmos, the individual and the collective, 
the observer and the observed, bound by a shared essence. In its 
most profound moment, consciousness discovers that the self is 
not a solid nugget at the center of experience, but rather a 
hollowed structure—open, fluid, interwoven with all others.



Remember Meister Eckhart’s view that the body is within the 
soul, not the other way around. This reversal culminates in a 
spiritual realization: what began as self-centeredness turns 
into a unified field of love, where ego and altruism are no 
longer separate—each cookie now contains the house, and the 
house is made from the cookies it contains.



Like the Ouroboros, the snake that eats its own tail, this 
inward spiral leads to a point where all distinctions—self and 
other, space and time, light and dark—collapse into a single, 
silent fullness.



And in this infinite recursion, this sweet loop of being:




You are not merely in the house—

You are the house,

the cake, the cookie,

the craving, and the bite.



With warm regards,
