MODERN FORMS 
OF SUFFERING

**
While it's 
true that suffering is inherently part of the human condition, 
recent decades have seen new and psychological more intense 
forms of suffering. From my extensive travels around the world, 
I've generally observed a trend of decreased happiness in 
younger people. Since this observation also seems to
[
be backed by science](https://bigthink.com/health/why-is-anxiety-so-common/), it has lead me to wonder if we are in the 
proces of losing 
our essence or "mojo." **



Therefore this chapter primarily targets younger readers, yet it invites 
participation from individuals across all age groups. This 
inclusive approach is particularly relevant in our contemporary 
society, where there's a widespread aspiration to retain 
youthfulness indefinitely. While there's nothing inherently 
wrong with this mindset, it's important to be aware of potential 
pitfalls associated with such a pursuit.




Despite my advanced age, I feel compelled to offer you, glorious 
youngsters and wannabe youngs like myself, not teachings, not 
even advices, but some perspectives you might find valuable.



Although my observations may seem exaggerated – acknowledging 
the countless youths leading content lives – they serve to 
highlight emerging social patterns and shifts in outlook, 
offering a clearer perspective on our evolving societal 
behavior. 





The Perfect Imperfection of Disruptive Velocity****

**We live in an era where one new technology 
skyrockets, while simultaneously, ten others emerge rapidly. The 
intervals between these disruptions have vanished, leaving no 
pause in the continuous flow of technological advancement. In 
his seminal 2005 work,*
[
The Singularity is Near](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near), *Ray Kurzweil forecasted a 
future where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence 
by an infinite margin, pinpointing the year 2045 as the pivotal 
moment. Observing the current trajectory of technological 
advancement, it appears this watershed—the singularity—may well 
be reached significantly earlier than Kurzweil’s original 
prediction.**


Echoing the timeless wisdom of Sophocles,* "Nothing vast enters 
the life of mortals without a curse,"* it becomes evident that 
rapid transformations carry with them inherent challenges. This 
adage resonates with profound truth in the context of swift, 
seismic shifts in our technological landscape, underscoring the 
paradox of progress and the double-edged sword it wields.



Reflect upon the millennia it required for the Yamnaya 
civilization to adapt their physiology to the
[
consumption of cow milk](https://www.science.org/content/article/milk-fueled-bronze-age-expansion-eastern-cowboys-europe)—a dietary shift that, over 
generations, rendered them taller through the acquisition of 
additional nutrients. Today, the rewiring of our brains, bodies, 
and societal structures no longer spans ages but unfolds within 
mere years, with the pace of change hurtling ever closer to the 
precipice of verticality.



Everything is Perfectly Imperfect

**In taking a broader view for a moment, I'm reminded, along with the reader, 
of a perspective often echoed in Zen philosophy: the notion that 
everything, in the grand scheme, is perfectly okay, or more 
precisely, perfectly imperfect. This approach to observing 
technological evolution through a historical lens sheds light on 
how past inventions, like the steam engine, initially caused 
societal upheaval but ultimately brought about significant 
benefits. The liberation of both humans and animals from 
laborious tasks through the advent of fossil fuel-powered 
engines is a testament to this phenomenon. Such historical 
insights lead me to a conclusion that the digital innovations of 
our era are not flawed in essence. Instead, it's the astonishing 
speed at which these technologies have been introduced and the 
subsequent disruptions they've caused in our lives that present 
the real challenge. **



The 
Updated (Outdated) Teachings of the Buddha

**The first four teachings of Buddha are essentially guidelines on 
navigating existential suffering.
Yet, the disruptive anguish we confront today differs significantly from 
Buddha's era. As 
[Slavoj Zizek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_Žižek) suggests, we live in a time of 
cynicism, recognizing the world's absurdities and injustices, 
yet still fueling the machinery of destruction—be it through 
weapons or fossil fuels. This 'happy' nihilism is evident in our 
massive consumption of unhealthy industrial food, compensating medicines, alcohol, 
drugs, and media, enabling us to bear our hyper-aware existence. 
We throw our cigarette butts on the pavement while protesting 
against the use of fossil fuels. Our behavior mirrors that of the Middle Ages' party plague 
processions, where participants knew the end was near yet 
continued and even exessed their revelry. **


However, it is actually a good thing that we know it.

For what one does *not* know, one cannot change.






The Rise of Story-told Feelings****
A phrase I 
frequently hear among the youth is: *"It feels like."* 
Everything is perceived as feeling like this or that in a 
reality where we essentially talk ourselves into a narcissistic 
mindset. This trend, likely stemming from the New Age self-help 
culture, places one's own feelings and verbalized 
self-realization at the center of the universe. We base every 
action on what our feelings dictate, aligning our social media 
likes with fleeting emotional impulses.



This has justifiably been 
critizised from various old school world academians for being a 
narcissistic trend.
Accordingly, the danish local bestseller psychologist, Sven Brinkmann, 
polemically formulates: *'don't feel your self'* as an 
antidote to the narcissim of out time.



In this sense social media has reshaped the configuration of our subconscious, 
diverging from the by now outdated Freudian focus on sexual 
shame. In the current era, shame revolves around not being 
perceived as happy, beautiful, and successful. While 
contemporary "woke" culture concentrates on reinforcing 
traditional perceptions of racism as a primary societal ill, a 
new form of shadowy, less overt racism secretly divides us into 
groups, where race and gender only plays a secondary role. The 
criterion is rather: either you fit the mold of being forever 
young, attractive, consumer capeable and successful, qualifying 
you for representation in something like a United Colors of 
Benetton advertising campaign, or you are subtly excluded. 
Those who don't fit this mold face exclusion, manifested in 
fewer social media 'likes' and engagements. In essence, both social 
acceptance and systemic oppression have become an integral part 
of the very fabric of social media. We have become quantifiable 
by the number of friends, likes and subscribers we get.



During the COVID-19 pandemic, the authority of scientific truth 
has been increasingly contested by the influence of online 
sentiment. This shift has seen the emergence of figures such as 
Andrew Tate, who leverage the digital platform's mechanisms to 
equate truth with popularity. In this environment, the metric of 
'truth' becomes closely tied to the number of views or 'likes' a 
piece of content receives. This phenomenon reflects a broader 
trend where the validation of information is determined more by 
its appeal to web audiences than by empirical evidence or 
scientific rigor.



• **
**THE 
PERFECT LIFE OF THE ENVIOUS AVATAR

**Social media is an insanely disruptive event we never voted democratically for. 
As a tsunami it just came without us taking notice. A noticeable trend among youth and adults 
alike is their 'wilfully positive' and performative 
selfie-behavior on social media. This coping mechanism entails 
the constant portrayal of joy, leading to the creation of an 
idealized life through digital avatars. I have observed a 
tendency to avatarize even the most intimate feelings 
and experiences. At the altar of the avatar we upload our 
essence. However, this worship of a vampire leaves us bloodless 
and drained, as the pursuit of avataric happiness becomes as 
cyclically destructive as relying on substances to recover from 
previous indulgences. As a result, we are drawn into a world of 
simulated wellness where any discomfort or pain is deemed a 
personal failure.




Social platforms, by their very systemic nature, seduce us into 
sharing and comparing our 'happiness-capital,' inevitably 
leading to envy—a sin warned against since ancient times. This 
cycle of comparison and envy only serves to deepen our societal 
divide, reinforcing the illusion of happiness while obscuring 
genuine fulfillment. The 
avatar-happiness we share on social platforms does not grow by 
being shared. It causes misery by setting a systemic stage for comparisions, and when we share to compare we loose 
our mojo. **


The social media performative ego is in a wierd quantum state 
where it exactly knows what it is doing and yet preferes 
blindness. This conscious blindness repeats itself in the fact 
that we know that our own avatars are professional liars, and 
yet we somehow tend to believe in other people's avataric screen 
projections. Here we find ourselves in a perpetual 'Zizekian' state of 
post-Edenic consciousness, reluctant to abandon our paradisical 
utopia even after realizing the shame of our true, unmasked 
selves hiding behind our glorious smiley-avatars. This unease 
leads us into a downward spiral where our avatar takes over our 
life.



The Prostechic Smartphone

**
The advent of social media, notably with Facebook's emergence in 
2004, marked the beginning of a profound shift in human 
interaction. This digital transformation was further accelerated 
by the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, which rapidly became 
the primary conduit for our engagement with the World Wide Web. 
The smartphone's ubiquity, as our constant companion from dawn 
till dusk — often the first thing we reach for upon waking, even 
before visiting the bathroom — has, in less than a decade, 
evolved into what can be likened to a prosthetic limb. This 
device has reconfigured our brain's wiring more significantly 
than any other development in a comparable timeframe.**


The prosthetic symbiosis between our body and the smartphone has 
made us an almost organic part of social media. We have 
transformed into cyborgs harboring split personalities, crafting 
simulacra avatars that attempt to escape our physical reality, 
constantly showcasing themselves in upscale restaurants and on 
splendid vacations. In this cyborgification-process we are 
slowly encircled by gadget-prosthetics tailored for all 
situations, serving 
as supports, aiding us in our escape from the metaphorical 
hospital corridors of our self created digitalized performative existence.




Jean Baudrillard and the Matrix****
Prior to the dominance of mass media, people shaped their life through engagement with what 
[Jean Baudrillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard) termed 
the '*real*.' Baudrillard, who envisioned the concept of 
*hyperreality* in the 1980s, could not have foreseen the 
extent to which social media would intensify this phenomenon. 
The reality of today has transformed into a hyperreality, 
saturated with
[signs and symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation), rendering Baudrillard's 
theories more relevant than ever. We are now residents of a 
virtual world of simulacra. This notion is powerfully depicted 
in popular culture, particularly in the Wachowski brothers' film 
*"The 
Matrix,"* which almost prophetically premiered nearly a decade 
before the arrival of the first iPhone.



Today the favorite and adictive junk food of the matrix-avatar is not suprising 'signs' in the 
form of likes. However, every time your avatar feasts in 
likings, your yourself is drinking saltwater to quench your 
thirst for the 'real'.



Seen in this light, the contemporary trend of letting the feelings take 
charge is not authentic. This new wave of "it feels like" - 
feelings are much more avatarized simulacra of performative storytold 
story-told feelings ready for being presented on a reel. Let me 
here give you an example. A young man, 20 years old, asked me 
for some advices concerning how to overcome his inner emotional 
difficulties. He really apreciated the advices and immiedeatly 
after made a reel, presenting the philosophy behind the advices 
he got. In fact, what he did was avatarizing his inner spiritual 
process and thereby making it 'un-reel'



In the newly formed hyperreal meta-dimension populated by 
signs, we have come to exist as matrix-avatars. Just as individuals with prosthetic 
limbs come to subjectively perceive these artificial extensions 
as natural parts of their bodies, our avatars in cyberspace 
begin to take ownership of our identities.




Our Aging Bardo-Culture

**The hyper-real matrix-like extension of ourselves has induced a profound identity crisis 
bordering self-alienation: Who am I? Am I my avatar? As we lose 
our traditional grasp on identity, our obsession with it 
intensifies. This resembles individuals caught in the throes of 
a challenging psychedelic experience, where the panic of ego 
dissolution drives a desperate cling to any form of identity 
that promises relief from the existential dread of becoming 
nobody.**


This predicament mirrors our aging culture’s existential crisis, 
reminiscent of the transitional state described in the 
[Tibetan 
Book of the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo_Thodol), *Bardo Thodol*. Wise guides counsel us to relinquish all 
attachments to usher in rebirth. Yet, it's the paralyzing fear 
of letting go that ensnares us in the bardo—the liminal space 
between life and death. It’s akin to being a child trapped in 
the midst of a birth channel, unable to move forward or retreat.



From Individuality to Identity: The Shift to Digitilized 
Sameness

**Individuality is inherently about internal dialogue—a 
process of discovering and maintaining a[ harmonious balance 
within oneself](/love/the-super-awake-flow). It's a personal journey towards self-definition 
and uniqueness. On the other hand, identity has, due to the 
reasons mentioned above, come to over-focus on 
conformity and alignment with external expectations, marking a 
shift from being unique to being identical with others. This 
transition reflects a hijacking of our intrinsic need for 
belonging and tribe by digital facades.**


The discomfort stemming from the gap between our real selves and 
our idealized online personas prompts us to modify our biology, 
aiming to mirror these digital projections. While individuality 
is deeply anchored in the tangible and real, identity now chases 
after story told illusions, propelling us into a cycle of self-simulacra. 




The Avataric Proces of Botoxification

**Practices such as botox injections serve as modern-day attempts 
to fit Cinderella's slipper, sacrificing our distinctiveness for 
a homogenized identity.
This pursuit of standardized beauty erases the unique 
characteristics that define us, turning human expressions into a 
monotonous echo of digital avatars. Women who resort to cosmetic 
alterations lose a piece of their individuality, their capacity 
to fully embody, express, and communicate their true selves is 
diminished. We become trapped in a performative identity, 
crafted from the lexicon of emojis and smileys, where every 
smile mirrors the superficial grin of a simulacrum, deepening 
our isolation from our authentic selves. In this way, the more 
we attempt to align with these artificial standards, the more 
profound our individual suffering becomes, ensnared within the 
spectacle of simulated belonging.**



Iron Men on the Run

**While men typically are a bit behind in the botoxification 
process of their faces, 
they often use sports, career, and even performance-enhancing smartdrugs as a 
means of escape, running from internal discomfort through 
physically demanding activities. At the end of this performance 
or fitness 
journey, there isn't a light of fulfillment but merely another 
tunnel leading to the next adrenaline rush. The prevailing ethos 
in this sphere is 'no pain, no gain.' This sportified American 
take on success encourages a *'Yes! You can do it!'* 
mentality – a relentless self-optimization process where pain is 
managed and controlled by the ego rather than 
deeply understood. Even meditation and yoga have become tools of 
self-optimizion instead of relaxation.**




We are now in a situation where we in a reinforced loop seek to 
escape the accumulating unsettling sensations in our bodies 
created by the pain of not being 'liked' by our 
avatar.



THE AWARENESS STARVATION OF THE BODY****
Even before the times of the smartphone we were busy with 
external things:




*"Of all 
ridiculous things the most ridiculous seems to me, to be busy


— to be a man who is brisk about his food and his work."*

S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard "Either/Or"




However, I 
wonder what Kierkegaard would have said to the vista of a train 
compartment full of reel-browsing passengers. Even the busy man 
on Kierkegaard's time were less visually oriented and more 
connected to a close, sensory awareness of his body. In my 
youth, while traveling by train, people would gaze out the 
windows in a kind of defocused manner. You can imagine what 
people did in the long winther months 
[in the mideval period](/civilization/civilization-and-consciousness-ii). 
They were staring into the fire while trying to stay warm or 
they were doing routine activities while immersed in themselves.




*
"A poor life this if, full of care,

We have no time to stand and stare"

*
[
W. H. Davies](http://www.englishverse.com/poems/leisure)




Even 
unknowingly, the state of staring nurtured our bodies through 
interoceptive awareness. Give it a try and experience for 
yourself: stare without focusing for a minute and observe how 
the interoceptive awareness of your body arrives like a whale 
coming up to the ocean surface for air.




An important factor giving rise to our newly configured 
pattern of pain is what I 
would term the awareness-starvation 
of our body. The greatest gift you can offer someone is your 
undivided, non-judgemental space-holding 
[awareness](/consciousness/the-mystery-of-awareness). Experiment 
with this, and you'll notice its impact. Similarly, the best 
gift you can give your own body is to immerse it in your own 
simple *tathata*, or suchness-awareness. Nothing nourishes 
the body more than a bath in this close-sensual presence of your own 
awareness.




Today, the immense importance of that 
dreamy irrigation of our inner body landscape is ignored. With 
everyone's eyes glued to smartphone screens, our bodies are 
neglected, left by the wayside like forgotten orphans. For 
millions of years, our bodies have thrived on 'zone out' 
moments. Now, suddenly, a significant portion of our energy is 
channeled into new bundles of neurons dedicated to our long 
distance sense of vision. 




Consequently, we are looking at ourselves from outside instead of 
feeling ourselves from the inside. We have become increasingly 
visual and mental, inhabiting alienated bodies we then love to 
watch in endless zombie serials. This shift towards a 
predominantly visual and mental engagement has rerouted a 
considerable amount of our energy towards nurturing a distant, 
external perception of ourselves, rather than fostering an 
internal awareness. As a result, we've evolved into beings who 
observe ourselves from an external viewpoint, increasingly 
alienated within our own bodies, captivated by the endless 
spectacle of digital content. This detachment, or scopophilian 
alienation, from our physical essence prompts a desperate 
yearning for attention, which we attempt to soothe with 
elaborate narratives about our identities. We are unconsciously 
hungering for the 'real' when we watch the 'reel'. Such a disconnect is 
akin to depriving bees of their natural sustenance, honey, and 
substituting it with sugar water—a superficial, inadequate 
replacement. Consequently, we've lost touch with the innate 
ability to genuinely feel and understand our bodies in their 
natural state, supplanted by a culture of narcissistic, 
performative avataric self-representation and the acceptance of deceptive 
narratives about who we are.



• **
**AVATARIZED VICTIMHOOD****
The phenomenon of transforming oneself into a digital smiley, an 
act of 'avatarizing,' finds its counterpart in a radical 
counter-trend. Amidst the luminous veneer and botox-infused 
portrayals of celebratory gatherings, there arises an *'avatar of 
darkness*'—a direct antithesis. This shadow avatar, conceived 
within the muted allure of media's sheen, stands in sharp relief 
against its counterpart. Social media's realm of illusion splits 
us in two parts, magnifying both the radiant and 
the obscure, thereby exacerbating our collective malaise.





The Rise 
of the Trauma-Avatar

**The connection between these contrasting narratives is found 
in their common foundation as constructs of the thinking mind. Their 
dichotomy evolves in an unexpected manner: the anguish derived 
from our constructed stories, previously essential for crafting 
avatars of succes and joy, is no longer concealed. Instead of succumbing to 
traditional Freudian repression, we now convert this paradox into a 
spectacle, comodifying and glorifying our recently unearthed turmoil. This pain 
is molded and repurposed into a celebrated state of victimhood, 
adeptly designed for the theatricality of social media 
engagement. In short we here wittness the upcoming of two 
distinct types of avatars:**
The glorious botox-avatar and the equally glorious victim and 
trauma-avatar.

Let us now look at how the trauma avatar glorifies suffering as 
a means to gain followers or endorsements.



The Commodification of personal Pain and Struggle

**The theme of personal pain and struggle has always been 
woven into the fabric of human storytelling, yet the early 2000s 
marked a pivotal moment in the visibility and accessibility of 
such narratives, propelled by the evolving media landscape. Much 
like our tendency to gravitate towards negative news, social 
media platforms have a knack for amplifying pain as clickbait.**



One notable instance of the new glorification of suffering is 
seen in Simon Cowell's emotional "golden buzzer" moment for the 
cancer-stricken artist Nightbirde on *"America's Got Talent."* 
This phenomenon isn't limited to television; it extends to 
films, series, literature, and the realm of social influencers, 
where dramatized real-life adversities or fictional struggles 
with mental health, addiction, and other personal traumas are 
frequently depicted. While these portrayals can increase 
awareness and foster empathy, they also risk oversimplifying 
complex issues or exploiting them to lure viewers. This raises a 
question about the boundary between sharing to inspire and 
oversharing for personal or commercial gain. Such narratives 
point at a new trend: Media-shared suffering and victimhood has 
become a social capital.



THE DISRUPTION OF MALE AND FEMALE ARCHETYPES

**The social media driven commodification of suffering has 
markedly influenced contemporary discourses on gender identity. 
Reflecting on the past, the gender diversity of the 1980s exuded 
a more vibrant, optimistic, and unguarded exploration of gender 
fluidity, in stark contrast to today's atmosphere. The earnest 
endeavors in advocating for transgender people's 
rights, while wholly legitimate, have also ushered in a 
narrative where certain demographics, particularly white men, 
are frequently labeled as inherently toxic. **


This climate of polarization has also bleed into the fight for 
women's rights with repercussions for both genders, contributing 
to a palpable tension in social interactions between sexes. 
Anecdotes from young men in my locale suggest that forming 
relationships with women has become a more difficult task. In Copenhagen, the sight of couples openly 
expressing affection has become noticeably scarce, a stark 
difference from the warmth and openness observed in Eastern 
Europe, where public displays of affection among young couples 
remain a common and heartening sight. At the same time wedding 
and birth 
rates are going down in the Western world.



The Modern Criticism of Masculinity

**What is increasingly evident in today's gender discourse is 
the dialectical shadow side of the masculine drive. Traditional 
masculine roles seem to be facing a crisis, rendering many men 
existential losers in the modern era. While conservative male 
commentators often link this phenomenon to the ascent of female 
empowerment, I perceive this phenomenon as indicative of a 
simultaneous systemic transformations taking place, where the retreat of male 
dominance is caused by both deeper societal imbalances in our 
late-stage capitalism and by overwhelming criticism of what is 
labeled as toxic masculinity. As
[
Slavoj Zizek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=DKGa6g8Kk5g) has pointed out, modern American psychology has 
labeled this phenomenon of toxic masculinity
[
as something bordering illness](https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/what-toxic-masculinity-and-how-it-impacts-mental). **



I dare in this context to venture into a realm of high 
abstraction that reflects traditional stereotypes, where the 
essences of male and female are seen not merely as biological 
distinctions but as psychological archetypical structures, organized like 
layers of rings in an old tree. These archetypes, emerging from 
half a million years of human evolution on the East African 
savannah, serve as a backdrop for my exploration.




Viewing 
gender through this lens, the masculine and feminine emerge as 
solid biological interfaces, meticulously sculpted through 
endless cycles of negotiation, all under the influence of 
society's rapidly evolving norms. From this standpoint, replete 
with the risk of oversimplification, I seek not to uncover fixed 
truths but to illuminate fresh perspectives that might offer 
insight.



In our discussion, we particularly delve into the dialectical 
shadow-sides of both masculine and feminine archetypes, 
mirroring the contrasting dots within the Taoist Yin and Yang 
symbol. This approach acknowledges the intricate balance and 
interplay between these forces, aiming to shed light on the 
subtleties and complexities that define our understanding of 
gender and identity through the ages.



Gender roles from the Stone-age and Today

**Let us go for a short walk back in time.
The transition from hunter-gatherer societies to agricultural 
societies did impact gender roles, often leading to more defined 
and sometimes more polarized gender distinctions. In 
hunter-gatherer societies, the division of labor was relatively 
flexible and based more on age, ability, and preference than 
strictly on gender. Men and women both contributed to the shared food 
supply, with men typically focusing on hunting and women on 
gathering. However, this division was not absolute, and roles 
could overlap. **


With the advent of agriculture, societies became more sedentary, 
and the accumulation of resources led to the development of more 
complex social structures. Agriculture introduced new forms of 
'man'ual labor and resource distribution, which often resulted 
in more rigid and polarized gender roles. Men commonly took on 
the heavy labor of fieldwork, plowing, and managing livestock, 
while women were more often involved in domestic tasks, 
child-rearing, and helping with planting and harvesting.



This division was further intensified by industrial capitalism, 
at least when we look at the upper and middle class. Women's 
roles were increasingly associated with domesticity and 
motherhood, idealized in the concept of the "cult of 
domesticity" or "separate spheres," especially in the 19th 
century. Men's roles were predominantly associated with labor 
outside the home in factories, offices, and other environments 
within the burgeoning industrial economy. Concurrently, women 
were often relegated to the domestic sphere, a realm 
conceptualized as the heart of family intimacy and cultural 
development, primarily focused on nurturing children and 
managing household responsibilities.



Production Versus Consumption

**The field of economics is recognized for its significant 
gender disparity in both participation and acknowledgment. 
Traditionally, economics has attracted far fewer women than men, 
marking it as a predominantly male-dominated discipline.**



One might speculate that this discipline is deeply entrenched in 
qualities traditionally associated with masculinity, perhaps 
echoing the same genetic predispositions that drove ancient men 
to hunt for as much meat as possible.



Thomas Hobbes heralded early competitive capitalism with a revitalization of 
the Roman proverb: *"Homo homini lupus est" - Man is a wolf to 
man.* (Leviathan) The wolf, despite being a collective 
behavioral animal, has since antiquity served as an analogy for 
the predatory egoistic individual. Hence, the wolf that kills 
far more sheep than it can consume has served to highlight the 
unsustainability of this drive freed from its original setting 
in solidarity. This projected male wolf now resides on Wall 
Street, emblematic of a system that perpetuates excessive 
economic growth and exploitation.



On the other 
hand, it seems that women are taking the lead when it comes to 
consumption. The irony is that modern women fighting for 
empowerment often blame men for being 
the toxic root cause of our relentless capitalistic 
overproduction. However, women are taking the lead in 
consumption, especially of luxury goods. Even if we subtract the 
female household consumption, there are 
[clear indications 
of a female lead](https://girlpowermarketing.com/statistics-purchasing-power-women/).



At times, broad generalizations can illuminate complex subjects 
with a stroke of simplicity. In this vein, I 
suggest that the traditional roles of men as hunters and women 
as gatherers have evolved within the capitalist framework to men 
predominantly taking on the role of producers, while women are 
often seen as consumers.



The capitalistic system of individual untamed competition and 
consumption unleashed the masculine hunting and the feminine 
gathering drives to serve a societal dynamism and fluidity never 
seen before. However, it came at the cost of the overall 
collective sharing of resources that hunter-gatherers seemed to 
display.



While this perfectly imperfect system has served us well 
and better than any other system in history, the relentless male 
production and female consumption now appear to be at a 
civilizational sunset. This aging structure is increasingly marked by challenges that appear 
insurmountable, signaling a critical juncture for societal 
evolution.



A pivot towards a gentler, more motherly nurturing approach to 
our planet seems imperative. However, the rise of female 
influence in society has been overshadowed by the darker aspects 
of feminism leading the charge. Instead of adhering to the 
shaman-praised archetypical story of the Earth as an 
all-encompassing mother and humans as a unified, sharing tribe 
of her children, women have utilized the darker aspects of 
femininity to overcome male suppression. This is understandable 
as a way for women to manifest their influence, but it comes 
with a price to be paid. Instead of finding a balance, we now find 
ourselves at the mercy of extremes, where it seems that the 
cultural collective female spirit is in favor of payback time.





Competition between Adoration and Cancellation

**Witnessing the dynamics around a friend who manages a 
high-end luxury brand for the wealthiest echelon illuminates a 
systemic issue far beyond individual character judgments. It's 
fascinating yet disheartening to see how many express disdain 
behind his back, mirroring a broader societal trend.**


This phenomenon aligns with the discourse on "avatar-happiness" 
and the envy it breeds within the veiled arenas of social media. 
Such platforms, while ostensibly spaces for sharing and 
connection, often morph into battlefields of silent competition. The extravagant displays of wealth and status, meant for public 
adulation, paradoxically engender private resentment. It unfolds 
in a twilight realm where competition is fierce, yet 
acknowledgment of this rivalry remains taboo. This dichotomy 
underscores a deep-seated tension between the desire for 
recognition and the discontent it spawns among onlookers.



In this context, the backlash against my acquaintance and his 
enterprise isn't just personal—it's a microcosm of the larger, 
more insidious dynamic that pervades our lives as an existential 
trait, now largely amplified by social media interactions. It 
reveals how our digital engagements, far from being mere passive 
pastimes, actively shape and reflect the complex interplay of 
admiration and animosity that characterizes human social 
structures.



The Influencer on the Razor's edge

**Integrating the view on the precarious nature of social media 
influence, it becomes evident that this hidden competition and 
the idolization of affluence on these platforms contribute 
significantly to the phenomenon of influencer cancellation. The 
celebration of perceived abundance can quickly turn into a 
crucible of scrutiny when influencers fail to navigate the 
delicate balance between authenticity and the exhibition of 
luxury. As influencers present a life of lavishness and strenght, they 
inadvertently stoke the flames of envy and dissatisfaction among 
their audience. This envy, born out of incessant comparison, can 
escalate into public outcry and backlash when the audience's 
threshold for inauthenticity is breached.**


This underscores the paradoxical nature of social media: 
a realm where admiration and scrutiny coexist in a delicate 
balance, each influencer's tenure at the top vulnerable to the 
ever-changing tides of public opinion and the insidious 
undercurrent of envy that comparison breeds.



Thus, the very platform that celebrates the ostentatious display 
of wealth, status, and influence also harbors a silent tribunal, ready to 
pass judgment on those who stray too far from the community's 
unwritten codes of authenticity and ethical conduct. In this 
digital age, influencers and their audiences navigate a complex 
dance of admiration and accountability, where every post and 
portrayal can either cement one's place in the social hierarchy 
or herald the beginning of their downfall.



On a more profound level, the mentality of followers bears 
similarities to that of the woke culture, characterized by a 
paradoxical fixation on dominance and the exhibition of power, 
while simultaneously rejecting these very attributes. This 
duality reflects a complex relationship with authority and 
visibility, where both admiration and disdain coexist, 
underscoring the intricate dynamics at play within contemporary 
digital cultures.



In the context of influencer marketing,
[
women significantly dominate](https://www.statista.com/statistics/893749/share-influencers-creating-sponsored-posts-by-gender/) the field, representing a 
substantial majority of content creators across various social 
media platforms. Furthermore, women are not only the majority 
within the influencer community but are also more inclined to 
follow influencers. Across different age brackets, a consistent 
trend shows women choosing to engage with influencers more than 
men, underscoring the significant role of female audiences in 
the influencer marketing ecosystem.



At the same time the minority of male influencers earn more 
money than their female counterparts, which again points back to 
economy as a typical male trade.




Female Shadow 
Competition versus open Male Competition****
Examining the phenomenon of competition reveals a stark 
archetypical contrast in gendered approaches. Men's competition 
could in this light be seen as a lingering vestige of our 
hunter-gatherer past. They have historically 
engaged in open competition, celebrating the win-win situation 
of the victor who had the ability to throw a spear one inch 
farther than others. This ability could determine the success of 
a mammoth hunt, thereby securing essential resources for the 
whole tribe.



Women, perhaps also due to a lack of physical strength, often 
navigate their rivalries more covertly. Woman more often engage in a twilight 
zone 
competition in jealousy with each other on the parameters of 
beauty and status. From an evolutionary 
perspective, this strategy aims at securing the genetics of the 
alpha male while ensuring the optimal survival conditions for 
offspring. Thus, individual women are not inherently inclined to reveal 
their strategies for ascending to positions of power.



While internal female power strategies in nature may remain 
concealed, what is vividly displayed is the collective female 
energy when it comes to ostracizing individuals from the 
collective. Historically, this has been a natural and legitimate 
way for women to wield influence and power in negotiations with 
physically stronger males.









I recorded this video at a wedding in Punjab, India, in 
2014. Even without understanding Punjabi, the body language in 
this clip speaks volumes. Women, armed with collectivity and 
laughter, defeat the challenging man in a ritual where the 
outcome was predetermined, and all parties enjoy it.





Nowadays, this originally healthy phenomenon has morphed into a 
darker version known as cancel culture. Seen from the brink of 
over-generalization, this new collective dynamic of the many can 
be perceived as a female shadow side phenomenon, born out of the 
disruptive systematics of social media.



Cancel Culture and the rise of *Mater Saeva Cupidinum*

**The concept of "cancel culture," originally a healthy 
feminine way of gaining influence now amplified and distorted by 
social media dynamics, necessitates a bold examination of the 
darker sides of female nature. Both the disclosed 
competition taking place on social media avatars, influencers and the open 
collective rage-driven cancellation happening to people with 
diverging opinions and expressions show themselves in this light 
to be products of the dark side of the feminine archetype. This 
archetype is configured and massively amplified in the social 
media landscape in the form of virally growing tribal pools of 
emotionally driven opinions in the form of ostracization. In 
this shadowy realm female competition and cancellation encompass 
everything in a much deeper and more painful way.**


I am here reminded of the Jungian archetype "*mater saeva 
cupidinum*" that translates to *"the savage mother of 
passions,"* highlighting a primal aspect of the feminine 
unconscious associated with overwhelming, often destructive 
passions and instincts. It embodies the darker, untamed side of 
maternal energy. In the contemporary social media world I would however, 
rephrase this Jungian archetype into *"the savage mothers** 
of passions,"* that underscores the collectivity of this 
wrath.**


A
Lacanian take of 'Being Percieved' versus being 'The Perciever'

**Let us now tap into complex discussions around gender 
perceptions, roles, and attributes as conceptualized through a 
Lacanian lense. **


Generally 
speaking, the idea that the masculine is the perceiver and the 
feminine is perceived can be related to traditional gender 
stereotypes and roles, which have been widely critiqued and 
reconsidered in contemporary gender studies.



Historically, many societies have attributed active, perceiving, 
or agentive roles to masculinity, while femininity has been 
associated with passivity, being perceived, or being the object 
of perception.



Contemporary thought, especially within fields like woke gender 
studies, sociology, and psychology, tends to challenge these 
binary views of gender. Instead, there's a growing emphasis on 
understanding gender as a complex, fluid spectrum that 
transcends traditional male/female binaries. This includes 
recognizing that attributes like agency, perception, and the 
capacity to be perceived are not inherently tied to one's 
gender.



On this particular point I partly agree with the 
woke discourse on gender.
At least within the realm of psychology, gender roles and 
perceptions are far more nuanced and 
varied than such an ald school binary division between 
male-perciever and female-percieved suggests. This elaboration 
captures key aspects of Lacanian psychoanalytic theory, 
particularly with respect to the concepts of "the Big Other," 
scopophilia (the pleasure in looking), and the dynamics of 
perception and subjectivity. Jacques Lacan, a French 
psychoanalyst, 
focused on how the unconscious structures our experiences of 
self and others, drawing significantly on the complex interplay 
between seeing, being seen, and the structures of desire and 
identification.



I dare here to simplify with this statement: The one in power is the perciever. 
A slave can never be the perciever. He will always be the 
percieved.



*The Big Other*, in Lacan's theory, refers to the symbolic order, 
the social structures, laws, and conventions that govern how 
individuals see themselves and others. This order is not just a 
passive backdrop but actively shapes desires, thoughts, and 
identities. It represents a kind of external authority or 
reference point that individuals internalize and which 
influences their actions and perceptions.



The point about the person in power being the perceiver aligns 
with Lacanian thought in that those who align with or embody the 
expectations of the Big Other can occupy a position of power or 
authority, becoming the one who looks, judges, or defines norms. 
This position allows them to "perceive" or shape reality, 
including the identities of others, who become the perceived.

Again here I would like to rephrase Lacan's term into *The Big 
Others***** **in order be more useful as a tool of 
understanding the contemporary viral social media driven 
collective waves of pure amygdalian judgemental feeling.**


Scopophilia, or the pleasure derived from looking, plays into 
this dynamic by emphasizing the act of observation as a source 
of satisfaction or control. For Lacan, the gaze (or look) is 
crucial in establishing the dynamics of subjectivity and 
objectification, where the subject becomes an object under the 
gaze of The Other. This process is not just about literal vision 
but about recognition, identification, and desire.



We must here 
not forget that this power of observation is exponentially 
magnified on the social media platform. The gaze of 
the Big Others **makes individuals constantly aware of how 
they are seen and judged, thus influencing their behavior and 
self-perception to an extend maybe never seen before.**


The insight that individuals can become both the perceiver and 
the perceived through self-reflection or self-surveillance 
reflects Lacan's notion of the mirror stage, a developmental 
phase where the child recognizes their own reflection. This 
recognition is fraught with tensions between identification 
(with the image) and alienation (from the image), suggesting an 
early internalization of the gaze and the dynamics of being 
seen. It implies a fundamental split or lack in the subject, 
where satisfaction is elusive because the desire is always 
mediated by the Other's desire.



This alienation is again heavily amplified through social media.
In these days the Lacanian Big Others have become massively digitalized. We 
are in the contemporary social media-mediated mirror landscape being objectified 
by the collective social media perciever. This perciever is not any longer 
automatically an attribute of the male-archetype. We are now percieved by the overt 
eyes of a collective amygdalian abstraction I would dare to name 
as *The Big 
(M)others*. A geomagnetic reversal has taken place where the 
masculine is now percieved through the big wrathful mothers watching us.


** **
Individuation versus Identity

**According to C.G. Jung both the female and the male archetype possess a 
dialectic, contrasting shadow. He described these 
archetypes as *'anima' *and *'animus.'* According to him, every 
individual harbors both archetypes within their psyche, granting 
us all the possibility to identify across gender lines on a 
psychological level. **


Jung's theory posits that the anima and animus are the 
unconscious feminine side in men and the unconscious masculine 
side in women, respectively. The anima and animus are not just 
about gender identity or roles but are more about the 
complementary and contrasting aspects of the opposite gender 
that exist within each individual. Jung believed these 
archetypes are universal and serve as a bridge to the 
unconscious mind. The anima and animus influence an individual's 
interactions and projections onto others, affecting 
relationships and personal growth.



Carl Jung posited that the path to psychological completeness 
involves a process he named individuation. This process demands 
the recognition and integration of the diverse facets of our 
personality, bridging the gap between the conscious and 
unconscious realms of the self. Central to this integration are 
the concepts of the anima and animus—the feminine and masculine 
aspects within us all—achieving a more unified and harmonious 
inner life.



In contemporary times, however, we observe a phenomenon 
reminiscent of a geomagnetic reversal in the dynamics of the 
anima and animus. This shift sees women engaging in feminist 
struggles through the adoption of traditionally masculine 
traits, while men, conversely, may embrace qualities 
traditionally seen as feminine. This paradox intensifies as 
women, in adopting a more masculinized persona, concurrently 
navigate a narrative that casts masculinity in a negative light. 
Through this inversion of roles, both internal and external, the 
classical male and female psychological archetypes begin to 
disintegrate and recombine in varied configurations.



The Tragedy of Identity

**Such transformations in gender identity and expression, 
mirroring the complexity and fluidity of psychological gender 
itself, could in fact herald a form of liberation.





However, transitioning to the concept of individuation, it demands a 
flexibility that is compromised when individuality morphs into 
performative identity. Drawing from Meister Eckhart's wisdom, *
"The spot I am standing on is small, but it must disappear,"* 
and his caution against defining oneself too rigidly:* "Beware 
lest ye take yourself as either this or that."*




Embracing a specific identity too 
tightly ensnares us in the web of solidified identity construction. In my 
exploration of spirit, I propose that identity-identfication 
is directly linked to suffering. This highlights the 
importance of maintaining fluidity and openness in our 
understanding of self, avoiding the pitfalls of rigid identity 
categorization, and fostering a journey towards true 
individuation. The paradox is that there is no liquidity even in 
gender fluidity.**


THE WOKE GLORIFICATION OF SURPRESSION****
Let's now examine how the contemporary woke culture interprets the 
dynamics of this broader wave of clickbait victimhood. In the 
woke's take on Foucault's 
post-modern perspective, every interaction, no matter how significant or 
minor, is viewed as a power struggle between oppressors and 
victims. I find merit in this viewpoint, although I'm skeptical 
that everything can be boiled down to power struggles.



However, 
it's undeniable that we, to a much larger extent than we 
often realize, are immersed in power games. These range from 
microaggressions to overtly dominant behavior. The subtler forms 
of these behaviors are particularly challenging to address, as 
they frequently pass under the radar or mask themselves with irony or humor when 
identified. I recognize that being on the receiving end of these 
subtle power dynamics can be deeply hurtful. Power games, no 
matter how small, obstruct our ability to exist in a state of 
natural happiness.



The Woke Masking of Late Stage Capitalism

**The approach of woke culture in addressing historical injustices 
and the consequently in our behaviour embedded micro-agressions, encounters several 
challenges. Focusing primarily on race and gender, it overlooks 
other forms of systemic oppression, which might be equally, if 
not more, significant. An illustrative example is the dominance 
of large multinational corporations that prioritize shareholder 
profits over environmental and human well-being, impacting 
individuals across racial and gender lines. I would dare to go 
so far as to call that systemic oppression in the sense that 
these systems in their self interest harm other people. This includes the 
distribution of unhealthy chemicals in over-processed food, 
affecting the health of people regardless of race. Similarly, 
the systemic influence of social media on mental health remains 
underexplored within woke discourse. These examples highlight 
the necessity of a broader lens to fully understand and combat 
systemic oppression. This blindness has made woke a darling in 
the capitalistic advertizing industry where gender and color in 
fact has become new tools to continue our blind consumption of 
commodities.**


Allow me to draw attention to a further contradiction arising 
from this lack of comprehensive perspective. While not 
definitively proven, the principle of Occam's razor intimates 
that the pervasive presence of over-processed, chemically 
enhanced foods might be a principal factor behind the obesity 
epidemic in the United States—a crisis that has been 
intensifying since the 1960s and currently represents a major 
public health concern. Despite the undeniable health risks 
linked to obesity, the current discourse influenced by woke 
culture complicates even medical professionals' ability to 
address this issue directly. Any reference to concerns over 
weight can be quickly labeled as reprehensible fat shaming, 
pushing the narrative towards an unyielding stance on fat 
positivity. This situation creates a paradox where the 
legitimate health advisories needed to combat obesity are 
stifled, overshadowed by the fear of contravening social norms 
around body positivity.

This stance effectively masks the impact of 
capitalist corporate greed, suggesting that despite its 
ostensibly socialist appearance, woke ideology may inadvertently 
obscure systemic failures of late-stage capitalism.



Woke and Laugther

**I find personally find it challenging to take seriously those who are 
incapable of laughter. Meister Eckhart states:




*"My Lord 
told me a joke. And seeing him laugh **
has done more for me than any scripture I will ever read."*




Rinpoche 
Tulko Lobsang is on the same page stating that true spirituality lies more in laughter than in the recitation of 
mantras, as it dissolves internal barriers, paving the way to 
what he calls the 'bliss-body.' 
([Youtube 
go to 40 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMVPWTUkT9E&t=2484s)



My recent viewing of a Netflix american stand-up comedy roundup 
from 2022 left me surprisingly unamused, sparking a single, 
tepid 'Ha.' This experience led me to question whether my sense 
of humor had diminished, but in fact it was the show itself that 
was to blame. The comedians seemed to tread carefully around 
'safe zones,' so the only little dry laugther I could 
muster was a joke about my demographic: older, 
'toxic' white men perceived as relics of neo-colonial, hegemonic 
structures. Here the stand-upper had a bit more courage to stand 
straight. However, such humor, allowed by the woke ideology, 
lacked genuine wit and veered into toxicity, underlining a 
broader issue: the erosion of authentic spontaneous laughter. It 
is simply not possible to be spontanous and at the same time all 
the time check yourself for offensive language as dictated by 
woke identity politics.



Woke culture has in this way sidelined the lightness of laughter in favor of 
political corrct shaming, echoing 
my christian grandmother's belief that laughter was sinful. Woke has killed the healing power of laughter. 
The absence of laughter is suffering.



THE MASKED POWER-GAME OF DIVIDE AND RULE

**However, the most significant problem lurking in the 
shadows is that in the process of identifying and addressing 
hegemonic power and privileges, the woke movement has become the 
very thing it opposes. The power dynamics and privileges 
criticized have in a reversed form become tools for the movement 
to gain power. This new wave of power display has evolved out of 
the broader trend of the previous mentioned commodification of 
victimhood. **


In this game, both the old neo-colonial white male power and the 
new woke power rule by dividing. However, the splitting and the 
power gained by the woke movement is far more unconscious than 
it was in the old hegemonic structures, exactly because the 
exertion of power on a conscious level is more hated and 
despised by the woke. 
While the intellect magnifies itself through 
the complex syntax evolved in the ivory tower of the academia, the unconscious shadow side in woke grows 
stronger and stronger.



Seen in this light, power and power-display were more visible in the old days. In 
the current landscape, both traditional forms of hegemony and 
the contemporary woke ideology operate by division, yet the 
latter's methods are less overt, driven by an unconscious quest 
for power that starkly contrasts with the former's visible 
displays through language, uniforms, and architecture. This 
shift towards a less visible exertion of power does not diminish 
its presence but rather embeds it deeper within the 
subconscious, making it more insidious and harder to confront 
directly. It has gone underground and here it thrives in the 
demonic darkness of the unconscious human mind.



The Religion of the Crowd

**With inspiration from Kierkegaard I would say that the 
individual, when merging into the crowd, loses himself and, 
indeed, paradoxically becomes the very embodiment of what he 
seeks to oppose. In this mass, the individual's actions and 
ideologies, no matter how well-intentioned, risk becoming a 
mirror of the hegemonies they aim to dismantle. Woke is above 
all a crowd phenomenon. It has no leaders. It has no center - 
neither as individuality in the individual or in the crowd it 
orchestrates. It has become an expression identity politics to 
the degree where identity has sacrificed the essence of 
individuality on the altar of religious 
righteousness. It has evolved into a realm of moral absolutism, 
mirroring a school of piranhas in a frenzied hunt.**



This scenario marks the tragedy of the woke collective: it obscures 
the individual's consciousness, leading to the exercise of power 
in ways that betray the original intent, thriving in the shadows 
of unexamined deeply split selves.



The phenomenon of Splitting and Meister Eckhart

**The more we in a state of high tide emotions split the world in good and evil the more we are 
in danger of becoming what we fight. In this sense the thesis 
and the anto-thesis always define each other. Let me in this context 
quote my favorit quote from my favorite mystic:




*"All 
creatures contain one reflection: **
one, that is the denial of its 
being the other;

the highest of the angels denies he is the 
lowest.



God is the denial of denials."*




The concept 
of splitting, a psychological mechanism where the world is 
dichotomized into absolute categories of good and evil, 
resonates deeply with the spiritual insights of Meister Eckhart, 
a mystic whose teachings transcend the simplicity of binary 
oppositions in the concept of the divine as a double negation.



Political Activism, Christianity and the Personification of Evil

**Christianity, despite its significant social contributions, 
has a lengthy history of combating its conceptual antithesis, 
evil, personified in the figure of the devil. In my view, the 
modern political activist movement employs an updated version of this 
religious framework, attributing personal qualities to what are 
essentially systemic issues. When Greta Thunberg exclaims,* "How 
dare you!" *she is effectively personifying a systemic 
phenomenon, similar to a closed environment where bacteria 
multiply until they perish from oxygen depletion.**
Woke is a wave in top of that larger wave reusing the same, 
basically christian software of identifying sin and then shaming 
the sinner.



Historically, 
no civilization has escaped decay due to its accumulating intrinsic systemic 
flaws, akin to the Roman saying, *
[
sic transit gloria mundi](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic_transit_gloria_mundi)*. This echoes the wisdom of Indian sages: 
*Everything born 
must die.* Imagine here the young and fresh leaves of an old dying tree, 
rottening from within crying: * "How 
dare you!" 
*In a way I understand the young Gretha. It sucks to live in 
the systemic endgame of a civilization. However, the use of the 
blame-game is like trying to fix a system within the dimensional 
confines of that very same system.

Albert Einstein is often quoted as saying, *"We cannot solve 
our problems with the same thinking we used when we created 
them."* This quote suggests that innovative solutions require 
a shift in perspective or approach, implying that to overcome 
challenges, one must think outside the confines of the existing 
paradigm or system​.

*

*Thus, confronting systemic challenges with guilt and shame 
can be seen as a contemporary and basically regressive echo of the darker aspects of 
Christian narrative. A brief look at history reveals the human 
tribal mind's archaic tendency to project personalized evil onto 
systemic processes, a tendency that has caused prolonged 
suffering by dividing and polarizing societies.



**In this context, Christianity, ranging from the message of 
love to the 
medieval inquisition, has both contributed to the societal 
ailments of splitting and offered the anti-dote in the form of 
the ideology of forgiveness and a concept of God as the denial 
of denials. In short: Love is the only medicine that can end 
human suffering. No statements born from judgment or resentment, 
including those expressed as micro-aggressions, have ever 
fostered positive change.**


A powerful insight by Nietzsche

**Friedrich Nietzsche's profound exploration of the human 
psyche delves deep into the intricacies of suffering and its 
glorification, highlighting the paradoxical nature of human 
beings to seek out and even revel in their own pain. This quote 
encapsulates Nietzsche's insight into the masochistic tendencies 
inherent in suffering individuals.






Suffering 
people all have a horrible willingness and capacity for 
inventing pretexts for painful emotional feelings. They enjoy 
even their suspicions, their brooding over bad actions and 
apparent damage. They ransack the entrails of their past and 
present, looking for dark, dubious stories, in which they are 
free to feast on an agonizing suspicion and to get intoxicated 
on the poison of their own anger — they rip open the oldest 
wounds, they bleed themselves to death from long-healed scars, 
they turn friends, wives, children, and anyone else who is 
closest to them into criminals. - 
Nietzsche




Suffering 
can become a potent and addictive drug. Nietzsche's 
observations remain as relevant today as when they were first 
penned, offering a stark warning against the dangers of 
glorifying suffering and the importance of striving towards a 
life-affirming mindset. **



STORIES KEEP THE PAIN ALIVE

**In British colonial India, there was a mutiny in 1857. Years 
later, living in North India, I encountered a newspaper article 
about a new wave of Indian historians who, after examining old 
records, discovered that following the suppression of the Sepoy 
Mutiny, the British initiated an ethnic cleansing campaign in 
the Northern Provinces, centering around Lucknow. Throughout the 
next decade, the British, now under the Crown's direct control 
after transitioning from the East India Company, discreetly but 
systematically targeted individuals of influence, including 
those who were tall and strong, in this densely populated area. 
These historians estimated that around 10 million people were 
executed from 1857 to 1867. Post-1867, recognizing the 
consequences of their actions, the British shifted policies to reincorporate 
Indians into administrative roles and opened educational 
opportunities in England. **




This account, possibly influenced by early 'woke' historical 
perspectives, underscores the harshness of British rule, 
although it might not be universally acknowledged. The 
[Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre), 
in Amritsar, Punjab, stands out as a well-documented British 
atrocity.
[
The Raj also orchestrated famines](https://bharatrakshak.fandom.com/wiki/Famines_in_British_ruled_India:_Their_Causes_and_Consequences) in order to force village 
people out of their homes in order to work with railroad 
construction. This raises the question: Why is there no 
lingering resentment towards Westerners, particularly the 
English, in India today?


****
During my travels in Sri Lanka, I observed a remarkable lack of 
collective remembrance similar to my experiences in India. The 
Uva Rebellion of 1815 saw the British forces significantly 
impact the Kandyan aristocracy, with the aftermath leading to 
widespread suffering among the survivors, many of whom were 
affected by diseases. This period marked a turbulent chapter in 
Sri Lanka's history, with profound social and demographic 
consequences. Despite the severity of these events and their 
impact on the population and society, there remains a notable 
absence of a unified narrative recounting these hardships. 
Today, Sri Lanka extends a warm welcome to Western visitors, 
reflecting a surprising way of dealing with its colonial past. 
This phenomenon suggests a unique approach to historical memory.



Why are we welcomed so warmly in these countries? It appears 
that both Indians and Sri Lankans have 'chosen' not to forge a 
collective narrative around these dark times, perhaps explaining 
the absence of enduring bitterness.



This observation has led me to a profound conclusion:




**It is collective stories that perpetuate old pain. **
We are story-and placebo driven animals.



Without a narrative, traumatic wounds tend to heal within a few 
generations - at least they seem to do soo in animals. It's 
crucial here to acknowledge that these surpressive 
incidents occurred within cultures where the prevailing survival 
strategy often involved perceiving the world as somewhat 
illusory. Even the last Mughal ruler in India, Bahadur Shah 
Zafar, adopted a 'Hinduized' outlook, becoming a tolerant poet.




The choice boils down to either forgetting or forgiving, both 
paths leading to similar outcomes in the sweep of history.



At the opposite end of the spectrum lies the enduring narrative 
of Jewish suffering. Jewish culture, with its embedded principle 
of 'an eye for an eye,' has maintained perhaps one of the 
world's oldest and most resilient collective trauma narratives 
through storied remembrance of persecution. This narrative of 
suffering seems endless, as retraumatization has woven itself 
into the fabric of collective identity. The recent tragic events 
involving Israel's actions in Gaza highlight a profound truth: 
the oppressor and the oppressed are intrinsically linked, with 
the roles of persecutor and persecuted easily interchangeable. 
This phenomenon, which I term *'reversed victimhood',* underscores the complex dynamics of 
historical narratives and their impact on contemporary 
identities and conflicts. Seen in this light, woke culture in a 
way more closely resembles the Jewish mindset than the Christian 
one.




Reversed 
Victimhood as a Tool of Power

**In the contemporary cultural landscape, the narrative of 
reversed victimhood has evolved into a potent instrument of 
influence, serving to imbue shame upon traditional figures of 
authority who have historically maintained societal structures. 
This fragmentation of self and societal coherence inadvertently 
perpetuates divisions by exacerbating historical grievances that 
might otherwise have found resolution.**


Drawing from Hegelian dialectics, the emergence of a victim or 
trauma-avatar represents a novel form of dominance, echoing 
Nietzsche's observations of Christianity's use of ideology as a 
means for the subjugated to confront the dominators. This 
process sanctifies the oppressed, granting them a moral high 
ground from which to castigate their adversaries. The stigma now 
associated with conventional forms of authority underscores a 
paradigm shift where the previously powerless leverage their 
victim status as an arsenal of moral superiority. This redefined 
battleground, laden with accusations of shame and guilt, compels 
all within its radius to navigate a precarious landscape, 
fraught with the risk of inadvertently triggering offense.



This dynamic signifies a reversal where traditional power 
dynamics are upended, enabling those once marginalized to assert 
control through the strategic deployment of their victimhood. 
This tactic, while empowering the formerly powerless, also risks 
entrenching societal divisions by solidifying identities rooted 
in grievance and opposition rather than fostering reconciliation 
and mutual understanding.




The meak now concuer the world through weaponized 
victimhood, armed with bullets of shame, guilt and so called 
emotional safe zones that forces everybody around the avatarized 
victim to dance an impossible dance on a ground full of 
landmines.



The echoes of reopened wounds transform into a collective 
outcry, morphing perceived oppressors into the latest victims 
via the mechanism of social ostracization, commonly referred to 
as cancellation. This pattern mirrors the current situation in 
Israel, where a historically oppressed Jewish community now 
finds itself in the role of oppressor towards the Palestinians, 
now 
facing backlash and cancellation in various Western contexts.




The repercussions of such entrenched retaliatory behavior are 
profound. At this juncture, it's crucial to explore the 
psychological and spiritual ramifications of exercising this 
kind of influence: Identifying oneself as a victim, in any 
context, jeopardizes the invaluable opportunity to dwell in 
one's innate state of contentment. This critique underpins my 
examination of woke ideology. The very essence of wokeism, which 
thrives on the perpetuation of suffering to amass the very power 
it ostensibly critiques, is antithetical to achieving a state of 
inherent happiness. This continuous cycle of grievance, 
reminiscent of historical narratives of suffering, threatens to 
perpetuate indefinitely, fueled by an unrested amygdala, far 
removed from the serenity of our natural being.



The Interplay of 'Woke' Culture, Trigger Words, and Trauma 
Responses****
Seen from this point of observation, there appear to be notable 
similarities between the reactive patterns observed in 
individuals with PTSD and behaviors seen in woke culture. Both 
can be quickly provoked into intense emotional states, often 
bypassing cognitive functions associated with the frontal lobe, 
which governs self-restraint.



Trigger words, originally linked to PTSD as stimuli that evoke 
traumatic memories, have found a new role within 'woke' 
discourse. They now identify terms that ignite potent reactions 
to perceived societal injustices, maintaining the same basic 
mechanism: rapid and often uncontrollable emotional responses. 
This resemblance extends to a shared ahistorical reaction, where 
the amygdala's dominance blurs the distinction between past 
traumas and current stimuli, leading to immediate and 
context-free reactions.



Such reactions, devoid of historical nuance, risk erasing the 
complexity of past events, interpreted through the lens of 
current sensibilities. This phenomenon is mirrored in the 
broader narrative of cancel culture within 'woke' culture, where 
there is a tendency to react to historical events with 
present-day urgency, prompted by specific trigger words.



The concept of 'safe spaces' intersects with these dynamics, 
aiming to protect individuals from triggering discussions. 
However, without careful navigation, this protective measure can 
foster identities centered on trauma, perpetuating cycles of 
reactive behavior and potentially leading to societal 
re-traumatization.



Addressing the core of PTSD therapy—and extending this to a 
societal imperative—necessitates moderating the amygdala's 
immediate, reactive responses to enable the higher brain 
functions, particularly those of the hippocampus, to 
contextualize and process experiences. This strategic approach 
fosters the development of more constructive dialogues, striking 
a balance between the need for protective 'safe spaces' and the 
imperative of engaging in meaningful discussions that honor the 
complexity of history.



A defining trait of the woke movement is its anachronistic 
perception of history, treating events separated by centuries as 
if occurring in the present. This timeless reactivity of the 
amygdala, treating every perceived threat with the same 
intensity regardless of its actual scale, overlooks the 
evolutionary role of the hippocampus in our cognitive processes. 
The hippocampus, our hub for long-term memory, has the capacity 
to reassure us that past fears are no longer relevant in our 
current reality, bridging our immediate responses with a broader 
understanding of time, allowing for a more nuanced reaction that 
distinguishes between past and present dangers. This cognitive 
balance is crucial for navigating the complex terrain of social 
interactions and historical injustices in a way that promotes 
healing and understanding, rather than perpetuating cycles of 
fear and reactivity.



The confluence of 'woke' and cancel culture exemplifies a 
perpetual societal story-told re-traumatization process, solidifying 
identities anchored in trauma through sustaining and even 
amplifying cycles of reactive behaviors.




THE NOTION OF CULTURAL APPROPRIATION

** One of the central concepts in woke is the idea of 
'cultural' apropriation. This concept in 'woke' discourse refers 
to the adoption or use of elements from a surpressed culture by 
members of a dominant culture, often without permission or understanding. This 
is viewed critically, especially when elements of a minority 
culture are used by members of a dominant culture in ways that 
are perceived as disrespectful, reductive, or commodifying. The 
concern is that such appropriation can strip cultural practices, 
symbols, or attire of their original meaning, contributing to 
the erasure or marginalization of the culture being 
appropriated. It often involves power dynamics, where the 
borrowing is unilateral and benefits the appropriator without 
acknowledging or compensating the source culture. **


The notion that 'cultural appropriation' is solely negative 
overlooks the rich tapestry of human history, where such 
exchanges, even those deemed adverse, have catalyzed the growth 
and enrichment of civilizations through cross-cultural 
fertilization. The Latin phrase from Horace's *"Epistulae II. 
i. 156" *serves as a poignant example, illustrating how 
Greece, despite its conquest, managed to captivate its Roman 
conquerors by imparting its art, culture, and wisdom, thereby 
enriching rustic Latium. This historical instance vividly 
demonstrates that cultural appropriation has been a driving 
force behind the advancement and diversification of societies.




*"Graecia 
capta ferum victorem cepit et artes intulit agresti Latio."

*
(Conquered Greece conquered her savage 
conqueror

and brought the arts into rustic Latium.)




This 
scenario implies that if the Romans had adhered to a mindset 
akin to modern 'woke' sensibilities, resisting the integration 
of Greek culture, the flourishing of Roman civilization—a 
cornerstone upon which much of our current culture is 
built—might have been stifled. It brings to mind a Zen saying: 
"To win is to lose, and to lose is to win," highlighting the 
paradoxical nature of growth and success.



In the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC) the Greek city-states, led 
by King Leonidas of Sparta, faced a massive Persian army. 
Despite the Greeks' defeat and Leonidas's death, their stand at 
Thermopylae became a symbol of courage and sacrifice, inspiring 
the Greek city-states to unite against Persia. The 'loss' at 
Thermopylae thus contributed to a 'win' in the broader 
Greco-Persian Wars, showcasing how sacrifice can lead to 
ultimate victory.



The fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks (1453) marked 
the end of the Byzantine Empire, a significant 'loss' for 
Christian Europe. However, this event led to the fleeing of 
Greek scholars to the West, carrying with them ancient knowledge 
that significantly contributed to the Renaissance. The 'loss' of 
Constantinople indirectly 'won' a cultural and intellectual 
revival in Western Europe.



In summary, cultural exchange, even when it involves elements of 
loss, defeat, and surpression, power-based apropriation and can 
lead to significant, unforeseen gains.



The evolution of jazz music and Mozart's Austrian 'hegemonic' 
appropriation of Balkan and Ottoman melodies serve as prime 
illustrations of beneficial cultural exchanges. Wienese copy 
culture targeted Turkish culture on all levels when the 
Austrian-Hungarian empire was at its zenith.



Pablo Picasso, 
who famously stated, "Good artists copy, great artists steal," 
drew heavily on African art to revolutionize Western painting, 
demonstrating the value of integrating diverse influences.



Moreover, even our biological existence can metaphorically be 
seen as an ongoing saga of cultural diffusion, wherein we are 
the composite result of previous life forms' adaptations. The 
mitochondria within our cells, for example, resemble ancient 
organisms that were co-opted billions of years ago to power our 
cellular processes. This analogy underscores the naturalness and 
ubiquity of appropriation across different realms of existence, 
challenging us to reconsider t




he boundaries of cultural 
exchange. What are the poor mitocondria other that slaves 
captured billions of years ago to serve in the energy factories 
in our cells?




THE 'WOKISH' THEFT OF VICTIM STORIES****
Moreover, this discussion sheds light on an irony within the 
'woke' perspective itself. The very criticism of cultural 
appropriation, when viewed through a historical and 
psychological lens, reveals that 'woke' ideology might 
unwittingly perpetuate a form of cultural dominance. By casting 
certain cultural exchanges as inherently exploitative or 
negative, it overlooks the complex, often reciprocal dynamics 
that have historically fueled cultural evolution and enrichment.




To articulate this more directly, the 'woke' movement, 
particularly within certain white segments, often unconsciously 
perpetuates a systemic appropriation of victim narratives. This 
strategy, which can be termed as the exploitation of reversed 
victimhood, involves adopting and repurposing the oppression 
narratives of other cultures or groups for their own ideological 
and psychological purposes.



In the 1960s, societal norms favored white identity, but by the 
1970s, perceptions began slowly to shift, with some individuals 
expressing a desire to be associated with other racial 
identities. This reflects a broader trend where the allure of 
perceived victimhood becomes attractive. The phenomenon of 
'pretendianism'—where people claim Native American heritage 
without genuine links, as highlighted by Buffy Sainte-Marie and 
exemplified by Senator Elizabeth Warren's claims—underscores 
this trend.



This intriguing phenomenon is particularly visible in Denmark, a 
country with historical ties to the slave trade yet without the 
immediate presence of those enslaved populations. Here's an 
illustrative anecdote from Denmark, where the discourse around 
'woke' culture is reshaping the humanities. A friend of mine, 
who runs an online women's magazine for intellectuals, found 
herself at the center of a shit-storm for using the term 'coloured' in 
a discussion. She was swiftly engulfed by a deluge of criticism 
from an online crowd, insisting that 'colored' was a term laden 
with microaggressions and white hegemony, and that the correct 
term was 'brown'. This incident did not lead to her 
cancellation, possibly because 'woke' culture does not yet 
dominate the Danish landscape as it does elsewhere, and she 
issued a heartfelt apology for her linguistic choice. Notably, 
the chorus of rebuke came from predominantly white Danes with 
academic backgrounds. It appears they've co-opted narratives of 
oppression not their own, wielding them as instruments of power 
and using them to castigate others for perceived 
insensitivities. This episode underscores a peculiar dynamic: 
the appropriation of stories of suppression by those not 
directly affected, for personal or collective empowerment, while 
inadvertently perpetuating a cycle of accusation and penance.



Such historical nuances contribute to a complex landscape where 
the appropriation of victimhood narratives by some white 
individuals or groups in 'woke' circles does not stem from a 
direct lineage of oppression but rather from an abstracted misguided solidarity, 
often rooted in personal frustrations and narcissim. This 
ironic twist reveals a deeper layer of the 'woke' ideology, 
where the genuine aim for social justice can inadvertently morph 
into a form of cultural dominance and narrative theft, diluting 
the authentic voices and experiences of those who have directly 
suffered from historical and systemic injustices.



Language has always mirrored the prevailing power dynamics of 
its time. Yet, as societal power structures evolve, expressions 
once laden with subversive undertones can become obsoete within the societal corpus, losing their former 
potency due to the healing balm of historical forgiveness and 
forgetfulness. An illustrative example comes from my own 
neighborhood, where a street was named after an 18th-century 
Danish slave trader. This figure had faded into obscurity, his 
legacy unremarked upon, until recent demands for renaming 
brought him back into a contentious spotlight.




Before the resurgence of sensitivity around language, sparked by 
the woke movement, such historical remnants had lost their 
sting, becoming as functionally obsolete as grandiose buildings 
from a bygone era. Post offices, libraries, police stations, and 
town halls, once symbols of authority and grandeur, now stand as 
quaint relics. In the digital age, their physical presence loses 
significance, leading them toward an aesthetic of graceful 
decline, mirroring the fate of English colonial ruins in India. 
These structures, devoid of their original context and power, 
invite contemplation rather than command authority, signifying a 
shift in how we engage with the remnants of past hegemonies.

Before the 
advent of the woke movement, who truly paid attention to 
18th-century statues, their histories and implications was erased in 
public consciousness. Similarly, old extinct expressions 
experienced a reawakening under the scrutiny of woke 
perspectives. Phrases and sayings, steeped in tradition and with 
no meaning anymore, were suddenly imbued with new significance 
and vitality.



An Angy Young Man

**I know a young white privileged danish man. In 
fact, I have known him since he was born. Despite his luxurious 
and safe upbringing, he developed great anxiety from an early 
age, being artistically gifted and very sensitive. He coped with 
feelings of unease and anxiety. That all changed when he met 
another privileged artist girl, but from a Romani background in the 
Middle East. She was woke, and soon, the young man became even 
more 'awoke' than her. In this transformation, his anxiety 
vanished as he joined the crusade for all suppressed people, 
from gender to race issues.**
Visiting his brother, he upon entering the appartment 
immediately began searching for offensive material. In the 
kitchen, he found a coffee container with an advertising image 
of a black woman, pointed at it sternly, and declared, "This has 
to go!" He then went on to accuse his brother of harboring hegemonic race 
stereotypes. The non-awoken brother, who had just completed a 
book manuscript, offered a copy to his woke brother. The woke 
brother hesitantly accepted the book, voicing concerns over potential 
offensive gender stereotypes. He was not sure he would have the 
stamina to read it. Throughout this interaction, the 
woke brother never inquired about his brother's life and 
wellbeing. Attempting 
to change the topic, the sane brother mentioned a recent trip to 
Poland, referring to the wonderful individuals he met there as 'Polacks.' The woke brother 
immediately criticized the use of 'Polack,' suggesting 'Polish 
people' instead. The conversation spiraled into polarization and 
enmity. While 'Polack' is derogatory in North America, in 
Denmark, it has nuanced pronunciations indicating respect or 
disrespect. However, the real issue was the woke brother's 
inability to see beyond american terminology, overshadowing his brother's 
positive experiences with a divisive narrative.



This reaction exemplifies how the very power dynamics criticized 
by the 'woke' are adeptly utilized by them, effectively 
obliterating the empathy essential for any form of 
reconciliation.




The woke brother's self-righteous response to an earnest 
expression of goodwill and intercultural openness indeed served 
as a micro-aggressive display of power. Paradoxically, the 
'woke' philosophy validates itself: from a pessimistic 
standpoint, all interactions can be distilled down to power 
dynamics, and those who champion 'woke' ideologies are 
particularly proficient in demonstrating particular adeptness in 
wielding the very power they themselves vehemently criticize.





This phenomenon could indeed be seen as narcissism masquerading 
as global empathy. It manifests in those who claim to be global 
empaths yet simultaneously lack the capacity to love their 
neighbor. The woke brother, who never possessed the mental 
surplus to show affection towards his own family, found a 
justification for his absence of love: he now labeled them as 
racists and bigots.



Zooming out offers a broader perspective on the situation. The 
woke brother's first significant interaction with non-white 
individuals, ranging from middle class to privileged, was his 
encounter with the Romani artist girl. Being raised in Jutland, 
Scandinavia, his exposure to other cultures was limited, with 
experiences not extending much beyond eating falafel in the 
local town. This context presents two possible explanations for 
his newfound empathy towards races and genders he has scarcely 
encountered. One possibility is that his awakening to woke 
ideologies transformed him into a super empath, genuinely 
concerned with the suffering of others. A more critical 
interpretation, however, suggests he might be appropriating the 
victim narratives of other cultures as a means to understand and 
address his own discomfort. This appropriation could be seen as 
a search for a narrative that offers solace or explanation for 
his personal struggles. His apparent narcissistic inability to 
empathize with his brother, even minimally, supports the latter 
view, indicating that his actions may be more about 
self-servitude than genuine empathy.




Now, the challenge we face is that he is not alone in this 
behavior. From my vantage point, I've noticed this becoming a 
widespread trend among the youth. They experience feelings of 
unease and anxiety, prompting a search for narratives that can 
contextualize these emotions. Upon finding such stories, they 
engage in a detrimental cycle, essentially reopening what could 
be described as Nietzschean wounds, leading to a spiral of 
retraumatization.




Viewed through this lens, it's less surprising to learn that
[Robin 
DiAngelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_DiAngelo), known for her work on racial issues, is not black 
but white. This observation underscores the phenomenon of 
individuals seeking to address their own discomfort through the 
appropriation of others' struggles, highlighting a broader 
societal trend.



The Institutionalized Hegemony of Woke

**In most universities and extending to American societal 
institutions, woke ideology has become the menace Foucault 
identified as characteristic of old-school hegemonic power. 
Alarmingly, woke ideology is now supported by institutional 
power, and very few dare to oppose it. Institutionalized 
cancellation goes beyond mere social ostracization from a coffee 
club—it can mean losing one's job and livelihood.**


Woke as American Cultural Imperialism

**Remember the incident where my friend was shamed and blamed for 
using the word 'coloured'. She is actually not 
the only one ending up in such a shitstorm. 
[South African singer 
Tyla](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67505674) sparked a debate after identifying as "coloured," leading 
to confusion and anger among American wokish fans. In South 
Africa, "coloured" refers to mixed race individuals and doesn't 
carry the negative connotation it does in the USA. Tyla's 
ancestry includes Zulu, Indian, and Mauritian descent, fitting 
the South African definition of "coloured." This debate 
highlights a lack of understanding about the term's different 
meanings across cultures. **


Reflecting on the young woke man's 
americanized critique of "polack" as derogatory, it becomes 
evident that woke culture acts as a form of American cultural imperialism. This 
perspective suggests that woke ideology exports its lexicon and 
interpretations globally, positing them as universal truths. 
Non-compliance with these standards risks social ostracization 
or cancellation, underscoring a dynamic where cultural nuances 
and differences are overshadowed by a singular narrative 
dominance. This is a clear cut colonial powergame.



When the woke ideology evolves into a dominant uniform narrative among 
Western youth, especially outside the US, it creates a complex 
and wierd amalgam. This blend consists 
of original and authentic grievances that are amplified and cross-pollinated 
with a youth culture that appropriates these very narratives to 
forge their own identities. Within this fusion, the initially 
legitimate and justified grievances are propelled into a 
perpetual cycle of psedo-retraumatization and a state of 
similacra-victimhood. 
This cycle blurs the lines between victims and oppressors to the 
extent that their roles become interchangeable, displaying a 
fluid ability to switch positions. As a result, the fundamental 
game of power not only persists but thrives in utter 
unconsciousness, perpetuating a 
cycle that, rather than finding resolution and healing in 
empathy and love, continues to propagate division and conflict. 




This social 
software fits the model of the 
[
Karpman victim 
triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpman_drama_triangle), consisting of the perpetrator, the victim and the saviour. 
In this context the saviour is the individual who have 
appropriated a story from the victim, and through this theft has 
elevated himself to a moral high ground from where he can shoot 
out justified arrows of anger and judgement.



This trend extends well beyond the realm of woke activism, 
epitomized by Greta Thunberg's iconic "How dare you" speech. 
The contemporary saviour is a political activist that has 
avatarized himself with a simulacra-victimhood, that like the 
phenomenon of gender fluidity can be composed of free floating 
signs in the matrix of social media to fit any need of 
expressing internal anger and discomfort. Recently, in 
Copenhagen, I witnessed a fervent protest outside a Louis 
Vuitton store. The protest leader, armed with a microphone and 
an amplifier on max distorted volume, unleashed a torrent of 
fire and pimpstone, captivating a growing congregation in a passionate call-and-response. Such displays 
of anger, while compelling, reveal more about the internal state 
of the speaker than the external target of their ire. From a 
meditative perspective, anger is a signal to look inward, 
recognizing that the source of our frustration often lies within 
ourselves. It's a simple truth: Observing without anger leads us 
toward genuine insight, while viewing the world through the lens 
of anger is akin to looking into a distorted mirror, reflecting 
only our inner turmoil.



I am reminded of an incident from my own childhood. My grandmother, 
an intense yet depressive individual, once saw me in a state of 
joy and rebuked me with the words:* "Stop this nonsense! Are 
you not aware that children in Africa are suffering?!"* 
This incident is etched in my memory. I ceased my happiness, but 
thankfully, only until she was out of sight. Aside from this 
instance, I never heard my grandmother speak about the third 
world. In truth, she did not care; she harbored many other 
narratives that could legitimize and rationalize her depression, 
and so she remained depressed. If she had been young today, she 
might very well have been woke or could have been an angry 
animal welfare activist. Insted she became a follower of the 
fanatic Christian
[Oxford movement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Movement)



I definitely acknowledge the validity and significance of 
narratives surrounding animal welfare, climate change, gender, 
and race issues. These concerns are indeed genuine and warrant 
attention. The issue arises when these narratives are 
commandeered by narcissistic individuals who position themselves 
as savior-like figures. It is in this context worth noting that 
a notable number of prominent contemporary spiritual leaders 
exhibit traits associated with the '*[dark 
triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad)*' of personality — narcissism, Machiavellianism, 
and psychopathy. This convergence is not merely coincidental but 
underscores a problematic pattern where complex social issues 
are exploited for personal gain and/or misguided attempts of 
self-healing. One of the favorite tools of manipulation a 
pschopat has, is the ability to make his victims feel that are 
'wrong'. To gain social power through making other people feel 
they cannot trust themselves is a speciality of the dark triad 
personality.



A short Time -and Zoom Out

**Reflecting on my critique of the woke phenomenon, I realize 
the importance of introspection and invite you, the reader, to 
assess my motivations critically. Unlike the anger-driven 
judgment often seen in public discourse, my approach is inspired 
by the [
Bhagavad Gita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita)'s narrative of Arjuna, who fights not out of 
hatred but for righteousness. My critique aims to shed light on 
societal contradictions without malice, hoping to inspire even 
one reader to recognize our inherent greatness beyond our 
dramas, thereby finding a place of vast freedom where critical 
thinking coexists with deep awareness of what hinders our 
presence 'here'.**


A Stone Age Brain on the Hunt for 'Explanations'

**Most of the operational systems in our brain do not comprehend 
language; feelings and instincts are rooted in much older, pre-verbal parts of 
the brain. When we experience internal discomfort, the small 
verbal entity within us struggles to discern the cause. This 
entity is fundamentally programmed to seek external solutions to 
survival challenges. Therefore, when questioning the source of 
our misery, it looks outward rather than inward. Far removed 
from the true emotional roots of our discomfort, we encounter 
various narratives that we can appropriate to (mis)understand 
our own chaotic, non-verbal existence as beings capable of 
feeling. **


We begin to comb through our repository of information for 
stories to adopt as our own. In this process, we become 
traumatized, not primarily by our own experiences, but by the 
trauma narratives themselves.



Recent scientific research reveals the profound ways in which 
the mind can alter our biochemistry, a phenomenon known as the 
placebo effect. This effect underscores the power of 
storytelling, an intrinsic human capability. What is often 
referred to as placebo in medicine is actually a facet of our 
ability to craft and believe in narratives. Our storytelling can 
either empower or debilitate us. Our beliefs manifest as reality 
both internally and externally, ultimately leading us to 
perceive a specific Rorschach inkblot in only one particular 
way. It no longer serves as a canvas for our otherwise fluid 
capacity for fantasy and envisioning alternatives.



The relationship between our 'soul' and our stories can be 
likened to the traditional method of dyeing clothes in India. 
Initially, linen is dyed with a color, then laid out in the sun, 
causing the color to fade. This process of dyeing and exposure 
to sunlight is repeated multiple times until the color becomes 
resistant to the sun's rays.



Why do we engage in self-victimization? What allure does 
adopting a victim identity hold? Why not embrace empowerment, as 
Jim Morrison famously declared, *"I am the lizard king. I can do 
anything"*?



Nietzsche highlighted that sufferers become 
intoxicated with the poison of their own anger, a notion that 
seems incredibly accurate. This peculiar form of intoxication is 
akin to the satisfaction self-harmers derive from the pain they 
inflict upon themselves. There's a profound dichotomy between 
the helplessness inherent in victimhood and the control 
experienced by those who self-harm. In victimhood, one perceives 
a lack of control, yet paradoxically, there is control in 
shaping and owning one's victim narrative in the form of being a 
saviour. This dynamic fuels 
the modern discourse on victimhood; relinquishing this 
narrative, once deeply integrated into one's 'soul-software,' 
becomes exceedingly difficult.



This privileged appropriation of victim narratives is 
harmful to those with legitimate and justifiable experiences of 
victimhood needing to be addressed. The authentic life stories 
of individuals who have endured true oppression are undermined 
by narcissists who claim to advocate on their behalf.



I'd like to clarify that when I refer to narcissism, it's not as 
a clinical diagnosis. The trend of identifying narcissistic 
behaviors on social media has morphed into a form of 
blame-shifting, not unlike the dynamics seen in woke-culture 
shaming and canceling. It's essential to recognize that to some 
extent, we all might exhibit narcissistic traits as a means of 
coping. However, through self-reflection and empathy, we can 
understand that such behaviors detract from our inherent state 
of contentment and happiness.




Imagine in 
this context a
[monkey 
scrolling a smartphone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTiZqCQsfa8).







The Story that ends all Stories

**It seems we are bound by narratives; to claim a life devoid 
of stories merely spins another tale. Yet, among all narratives 
we weave, the most perilous is the claim of victimhood we adopt 
as our own—a toxic fiction that ensnares the soul.



Allow me to share a guiding narrative of my own, though its 
adoption is yours to decide.



In moments of clarity, a profound realization dawns upon me: I 
transcend the confines of any tale my mind conjures. This 
realization, a spontaneous awakening to my inherent 
completeness, echoes a truth about us all—we are already whole 
and perfect, beyond the limited stories we're told.



[Papaji](papaji_and_meditation.htm)'s exhortation, "*Wake 
up and roar,*" becomes not just a call to action but a 
recognition of our innate freedom. To howl at the full moon is 
to embrace our boundless essence, free from the constraints of 
time and space.



In gratitude, the need for understanding dissolves, revealing a 
simple truth: we are the narrative and the narrator, infinitely 
more vast than any story we tell.



From that space alone, actions can take place, that indeed will 
change the world for the better.
