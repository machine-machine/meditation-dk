CIVILIZATION AND CONSCIOUSNESS - PART I

*Buddhism and Christianity seen as Civilizational Self-control 
Zones

*****

**In this exploration, we delve into how historical societal 
developments have laid the groundwork for enhanced living 
conditions, thereby nurturing the growth of consciousness. As 
previously discussed in our
[chapter on 
Consciousness](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia), while the core nature of consciousness 
remains largely enigmatic, we understand that aspects like 
language-based cognition and the development of analytical 
reasoning are central to its operation. These facets of 
consciousness have been primarily cultivated within the 
nurturing environments of religious institutions.**


As we proceed, we will focus more closely on consciousness, 
considering it as the pinnacle of humanity's neural evolution. 
This advanced aspect of our neural architecture, being a recent 
evolutionary development, is also our most fragile. In times of 
stress, this delicate flame of consciousness can be easily 
threatened. Therefore, the progress of civilization can be 
likened to a series of architectural projects, constructing 
systems of self-regulation that support and allow this nascent 
bio-cognitive function to thrive.



On the cusp of analogy, one might contend that an intricate 
network of communication and trade, as established by 
civilization, reflects a more sophisticated network of neurons 
within the brain. There is a tandem progression between 
civilization and consciousness, each evolving and becoming more 
complex in concert.



The inception of civilization saw 
us evolve from beings predominantly governed by raw 
[instinctual awareness](/consciousness/the-mystery-of-awareness) 
to those more in tune with [
consciousness](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia). In the ensuing sections, I will adopt a 
materialist-historical lens to delve into consciousness. While I 
don't strictly adhere to materialism as a philosophical 
standpoint, I regard it as one of the many potent tools for 
comprehension.




Starting our exploration from the ice age might be tempting, but 
given the sparse and often inconsistent data from that era, our 
journey will commence with closer look at the trade routes 
beginning at the time of the conquests of Alexander the Great. 
In this context it's crucial to acknowledge that during these 
times, a staggering 60% of the world's population made their 
homes along these trade conduits from the Far East to the Middle 
East.



My goal is to illustrate the interplay between consciousness and 
civilization: how consciousness contributes to the building of 
civilization, and conversely, how civilization fosters the 
development of consciousness. Simultaneously, we must consider 
religions and religious institutions as prime environments for 
nurturing the growth of consciousness. In this exploration, 
personal belief in religion is irrelevant. Even a 
fictional narrative can unite us in shared realms of abstract 
consciousness, demonstrating how collective beliefs, whether 
factual or fictional, are able to create
[a shared field of 
consciousness](/fields/fields-of-consciousness).

CIVILIZATION AND THE BIRTH OF 
NON DUAL CONSCIOUSNESS

*The Pivotal Role of Silk Routes in the Confluence of 
Civilizations and Consciousness

*
**In the crucible of interaction between East and West, both 
cultures underwent irrevocable transformations that have left an 
indelible impact on our world. While it might seem like a 
digression to delve deeply into the unfolding of civilization in 
the attempt to understand the unfoldment of human consciousness, 
this significant facet of history anyhow warrants closer 
attention. 




The advent of human civilization and consciousness 
was propelled dramatically forward with the establishment of the Silk Roads, 
famously known for bridging China with Europe. Yet, the earlier trade networks 
that connected India, the Middle East, and Southern Europe are often not given 
due recognition. As highlighted by Giovanni Veradi, the significance of 
North-western India in the realm of Buddhist and Indian studies has been largely 
underestimated:




*"North-western India enjoys, or rather suffers 
from,**
a peculiar situation in the field of Buddhist and Indian studies."

*'Buddhism in North-western India and 
Eastern Afghanistan'




I would venture to broaden Veradi's insight to 
encompass not only religious aspects but also cultural and commercial exchanges. 
Similarly, its neighbor, the
[Greco-Bactrian 
Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom), was one of the wealthiest and most influential states at its peak. 
This is reflected in the title of H.G. Rawlinson's work: "*Bactria, The 
History of a Forgotten Empire".*



In this section, I will focus my analysis on the vibrant 'trade synapses' that 
linked India with the Western world, deliberately omitting China from this 
discussion.

TRi-NiTaS



To offer a glimpse into the 
forthcoming discussion let's contemplate the Borromean rings—a 
symbol of interconnectedness. The sculpture on the left 
illustrates the Buddhist Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Sangha, and 
the Dharma, known as the TRi-RaTNaS in Sanskrit. In parallel, 
the image on the right represents the Christian Holy Trinity, 
termed TRi-NiTaS in Latin. These symbols, though from distinct 
traditions, both convey a unity that transcends individual 
elements, hinting at the profound interrelation between 
civilization and consciousness we are set to explore.



Buddhism and Christianity in Mutual Co-creation

**It's impossible to envision Buddhism as we know it without 
acknowledging the influences of Greek thought, just as we can't fully understand 
the foundations of Christianity without considering its debts to Buddhist 
philosophy. As Max Müller states in "*India: What It Can Teach Us*," there 
are striking resemblances between Buddhism and Christianity that are impossible 
to ignore, particularly given that Buddhism predates Christianity by at least 
four centuries. He encourages scholarly exploration to uncover the historical 
channels through which Buddhism might have influenced Christian thought:




*That there are startling 
coincidences between Buddhism and Christianity cannot be denied, 
and it must likewise be admitted that Buddhism existed at least 
400 years before Christianity. I go even further, and should 
feel extremely grateful if anybody would point out to me the 
historical channels through which Buddhism had influenced 
Christianity.***India: What it can teach us - Max Müller



In a similar vein, the statement 
from Draaper's "*Intellectual Development of Europe*" also 
acknowledges that if European ideas made their way to the far 
East via the Bactrian Empire, then it's also likely that Asiatic 
ideas, in turn, seeped into European consciousness through 
similar channels.




*If through the Bactrian Empire 
European ideas were transmitted to the far East, through that 
and similar channels Asiatic ideas found their way to Europe.

*Draaper: Intellectual Development of Europe, I. ii.




Elaine Pagels, a British scholar of Buddhism, observes:





"Yet the gnostic Gospel of Thomas relates that as soon as Thomas 
recognizes him, Jesus says to Thomas that they have both 
received their being from the same source... Does not such 
teaching—the identity of the divine and human, the concern with 
illusion and enlightenment, the founder who is presented not as 
Lord, but as spiritual guide—sound more Eastern than Western? 
Some scholars have suggested that if the names were changed, the 
'living Buddha' appropriately could say what the Gospel of 
Thomas attributes to the living Jesus. Could Hindu or Buddhist 
tradition have influenced gnosticism?... Trade routes between 
the Greco-Roman world and the Far East were opening up at the 
time when gnosticism flourished (AD 80–200); for generations, 
Buddhist missionaries had been proselytizing in Alexandria. We 
note, too, that Hippolytus, who was a Greek-speaking Christian 
in Rome (c. 225), knows of the Indian Brahmins, and includes 
their tradition among the sources of heresy..."





[
This quote provides](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Buddhist_influences_on_Christianity) an insightful perspective on the 
similarities between certain aspects of Buddhist and Christian 
teachings, suggesting a potential historical connection through 
trade routes and cultural exchanges.



THE SILK ROAD AND OCRAM'S RAZOR

**Despite the paucity of direct evidence conclusively 
establishing Christianity as a Western adaptation of Buddhist 
principles, the hypothesis merits further investigation. This 
inquiry, guided by the principles of Occam's Razor, aims to 
navigate through the complex web of historical, philosophical, 
and cultural contexts. By applying this analytical tool, which 
favors simpler explanations over more complex ones, we can 
explore whether the paths of these two great religious 
traditions might have intersected in a meaningful way.**


Our exploration will concentrate on circumstantial evidence, 
such as the historical timelines of Buddhism and early 
Christianity, and the extensive network of trade routes like the 
Silk Road, which facilitated rich cultural
**exchanges between the East and West. This approach will 
allow us to consider the possibility of ideological and 
philosophical transmissions between these two regions.**


Furthermore, we will delve into the intriguing parallels between 
Buddhist and Christian teachings. This comparative analysis will 
focus on similar ethical teachings, motifs in parables, and the 
overarching philosophies present in both religions. Such 
parallels, while not definitive proof of direct influence, can 
provide insights into the shared human experiences and universal 
truths that these religions encapsulate.



Interpretative analysis will also play a crucial role in this 
exploration. We will examine how religious ideas and practices 
often evolve by incorporating elements from existing beliefs and 
how these adaptations are understood by various scholars and 
historians. This will include a consideration of the syncretic 
nature of religious development and the challenges in tracing 
the origins of specific doctrines or practices.



It is important to note that while this investigation aims to 
present persuasive arguments for Buddhist influences on 
Christianity, it inherently recognizes the speculative nature of 
such a thesis.



SPICE TRADE AND RELIGION

**Since the era of Alexander the Great, a vibrant spice trade 
has flourished between the Greeks and India, 
symbolizing a broader exchange far beyond mere commodities. The 
Silk Road, renowned for its commercial significance, functioned 
as a dynamic conduit for the exchange of ideas and cultural 
practices, potentially extending to the philosophical and 
spiritual concepts that influenced early Christianity. The 
impact of this trade is metaphorically akin to the Roman 
culinary adaptation of Indian spices. The Roman Empire's spice 
trade with India began following the conquest of Egypt by 
Augustus in 30 BCE. This conquest opened up new trade routes and 
opportunities, significantly impacting the scope and nature of 
the spice trade between these two regions. The introduction of these 
exotic flavors didn't lead to the Romans directly replicating 
Indian cuisine; rather, it inspired a transformative fusion 
within their own culinary traditions, creating something 
uniquely new while retaining a Roman essence.**


This analogy serves as a potent metaphor for the potential 
cross-pollination of religious ideas. Just as spices subtly yet 
significantly altered Roman cuisine, it is plausible to suggest 
that the religious and philosophical ideas traveling along these 
trade routes might have similarly 'spiced up' the religious and 
cultural life in the Western reaches of these networks. 
Buddhism, which had already established a wide presence in Asia 
by the time of these exchanges, could have feasibly left subtle 
imprints on the evolving religious thoughts in the West.



Thus, in this context, the suggestion that emerging Western 
religious thought, particularly early Christianity, could have 
been influenced by Eastern philosophies like Buddhism becomes a 
compelling hypothesis. It proposes a scenario where the essence 
of Christianity is preserved, yet it is enriched and subtly 
transformed by the infusion of ideas and concepts borne along 
the Silk Road, mirroring the culinary metamorphosis induced by 
the spice trade.


**
**
Buddhism's Influence on Christianity: Subtle and Overlooked

**The subtle impact of Buddhism on Christianity is partly due 
to Buddhism's understated, decentralized spread. Its peaceful 
dissemination, focused on universal moral teachings rather than 
charismatic leaders, is less apparent in historical records 
compared to the more overt conversion efforts of later Christian 
and Islamic missions. This makes Buddhism's influence on other 
religions, including Christianity, more elusive and difficult to 
document.**


THE FOLCLORIC SPREAD OF THE JATAKA TALES

**As dusk fell upon the caravanserais connecting the East with 
the West, the glow of firelight became the backdrop for 
storytelling. Since the time of the Buddha, oral folkloric 
spread tales evolved on the Gangetic plains. These tales are 
today known as the 



As twilight descended on the 
caravanserais bridging East and West, the flicker of firelight 
set the stage for storytelling. These tales, originating from 
the Buddha's era on the Gangetic plains, are known today as the
[Jataka 
tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jataka_tales). Laden with moral teachings, they provided more than 
just entertainment for travelers; they spread Buddhism's ethical 
principles. This dissemination wasn't just of religious doctrine 
but a universal ethos of kindness and morality, adaptable across 
various cultures. The Jataka tales' universal themes of ethical 
behavior resonated deeply along the Silk Road, interweaving into 
diverse spiritual traditions and nurturing a rich cultural 
exchange.



The Jataka tales, a cornerstone of 
oral tradition, linked distant civilizations, traveling with 
caravans from India to Persia and even to Scandinavia. In 
Denmark, for instance, the Molbo tales, according to prefatory 
notes in collections of these stories, are believed to have 
roots in the Jataka narratives. While specific cultural elements 
like caste distinctions didn't transfer to Danish versions, the 
core storytelling principles endured. The
[Danish 
Molbo tales](http://folkmasa.org/motiv/at.php?mishtane=1696) adapt these narratives, replacing the 'ignorant' 
Brahmins with 'naive' Molboes, preserving the Jataka's original 
narrative structures. This adaptation maintains the satirical 
humor intended to evoke laughter, demonstrating how the core 
structure and purpose of the Jataka tales have been retained and 
localized in Danish folklore.**


Holberg's "Jeppe on 
the Hill": A Tale of Two 
Interpretations

**From oral traditions these wandering tales made their way 
into litterature and drama. The Danish author and enlightenment 
philosopher, [
Ludvig Holberg](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q216692)'s "*Jeppe on the Mountain*" serves as an 
especially interesting example of cultural adaptation. According 
to [Kaare 
Foss](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/K&aring;re_Foss) in "*Konge for en dag*" ("*King for a Day*"), 
Ludvig Holberg's "*Jeppe p&aring; Bjerget*" ("*[Jeppe 
of the Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeppe_on_the_Hill)*") serves as example of how stories adapt and 
evolve across cultures and epochs. In Holberg's rendition, 
Jeppe, a poor and humble man, awakens to find himself in the 
luxurious circumstances of a baron. This story traces its 
lineage back through various European adaptations to "*One 
Thousand and One Nights*," a collection with Persian origins. 
Even further back, the narrative can be traced to Indian Jataka 
tales where the protagonist, usually a poor man, wakes up in a 
palace, suddenly a maharaja (king).**


The original Indian version focuses on the moral theme of 
"maya," or illusion. It poses a question: are you a beggar 
dreaming you're a king, or a king dreaming you're a beggar? This 
foundational concept is, interestingly, lost in the earliest 
European adaptations. These versions more reflect the nobility's 
disdain for the aspirations of the lower classesrather than the 
philosophical concept of illusion.

The moral in Holberg's unique adaptation, centers on the dangers 
of role-swapping and the inadequacies of a commoner 
impersonating a nobleman. Thus, the same story reflects 
different cultural values and concerns when it travels.



A Complex Web of Narratives

**Even 
[
Hans Christian Andersen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen)'s famous tale "*[The 
Emperor's New Clothes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor's_New_Clothes)*" echoes this ancient exchange. Its 
moral lesson about a child's innocence piercing through social 
pretense finds its parallel in Indian traditions of wearing very 
fine silk, so fine that it is almost invisible.**


*The Emperor's New Clothes* has long been cited as a 
classic fable cautioning against vanity and the unwillingness to 
face uncomfortable truths. In this story, the emperor, swayed by 
his own vanity and the cunning of his advisors, parades naked in 
the belief that he is wearing "invisible" clothes visible only 
to the wise and competent.



While this story often is read as a unique product of European 
folklore, it shares intriguing parallels with older traditions 
traceable to the Silk Road's influence. One such connection lies 
in the material said to be used for the emperor's "new clothes" 
— a fabric so fine and luxurious that it appears invisible. This 
aspect of the tale have roots in ancient Indian traditions 
around silk clothing.



In Buddhist iconography, religious figures are sometimes 
depicted wearing extremely fine silk, so delicate that it 
renders them almost unclothed. This portrayal, where their forms 
are subtly draped, implies that the fabric's fineness is a 
symbol of spiritual significance. The concept of "shunyata" or 
spiritual emptiness is mirrored in these almost non-existent 
garments, creating a paradox where a dress so valuable 
essentially becomes invisible, symbolizing kingly renunciation. 
This juxtaposition of opposites — value and non-existence — 
serves as a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment and 
renunciation in Buddhist thought.



This intriguing paradox resonates through history, including 
into the Mughal period. For instance, Emperor Akbar once 
reproached his daughter for appearing naked before him. Her 
response revealed a subtle cultural nuance: she was actually 
adorned in three layers of extremely fine silk. This incident 
highlights the cultural and historical continuity of the value 
placed on fine, almost imperceptible silk, embodying a blend of 
modesty, luxury, and the nuanced perceptions of material and 
appearance in different cultural contexts.



The enduring legacies and widespread influence of these cultural 
constructs demonstrate the deep interconnectivity of the ancient 
world. This interconnectedness is evident both historically and 
geographically, revealing a rich tapestry of cultural exchanges 
that transcended regional and temporal boundaries.



Jesus and Buddha: Icons in Pan-viral Storytelling

**Is Christian baptism rooted in ancient river cultures? In 
India, a timeless realm, millions still perform baptism-like 
rituals in the Ganges at Varanasi. **


Religious ideas, like water, flow through time and space, 
morphing to fit the cultural terrains they traverse. Religions 
and their leaders are thus adaptive reconstructions, crafted 
from pre-existing elements. Figures like Jesus and Buddha emerge 
from these ideological streams, embodying humanly shaped 
channels of thought.




To illustrate the 
transmutation of stories across cultures, consider the tale of a 
clever young man from the reign of the Indian Emperor Akbar in 
the 16th Century, which later became associated with the Danish 
King Christian IV in the 17th Century. In the Indian narrative, 
a bright youth impresses Akbar with his wit at a crossroads and 
is subsequently invited to the royal palace at Fatehpur Sikri. 
Upon his arrival, he is extorted by a guard demanding half of 
whatever reward he receives from the emperor. Cunningly, the 
young man requests 100 lashes from Akbar, who, upon 
understanding the situation, admires the young man's ingenuity 
and offers him a position in his ministry instead.



In Denmark, a tale echoes this pattern with King Christian IV. 
He is said to have rescued a young man who fell through the ice 
between Copenhagen and Malm&oslash;. In the court, an event unfolds 
reminiscent of the Fatehpur Sikri story, including a guard 
confiscating the young man's diamond ring and his subsequent 
request for 100 lashes. Within 50 years, this narrative, perhaps 
an amalgamation of the Danish king's rescue and Akbar's tale, 
evolved to depict Christian IV as a generous ruler. This 
illustrates how stories like that of Jesus may have similarly 
evolved through such amalgamations.



ACADEMIC EUROCENTRISM IN RELIGIOUS STUDIES

**In the scholarly investigation of world religions, there 
seems to be a discernible hesitancy within academia to fully 
explore the interplay and influence of stories and philosophies 
across different cultures. Unlike the field of world literature, 
where scholars like Professor K&aring;re Foss readily trace literary 
influences from the Gangetic plains to Scandinavia, religious 
studies often exhibit a contrasting approach. This field appears 
less inclined to acknowledge or investigate the potential 
cross-cultural fertilization of religious ideas and narratives.**


The strong resistance within academic circles to theories like 
those proposed by Dr. Phil Christian Lindtner, concerning the 
origins of Christianity in Buddhism, may stem from a combination 
of both justified scientific skepticism and less objective 
factors. While Lindtner's hypotheses might be oversimplified in 
their approach, the vehement opposition they encounter points to 
a deeper issue within the field. This resistance suggests a 
complexity in academic discourse that transcends simple 
scholarly disagreement.



It is worth questioning if institutional biases and collective 
pride in Western academia might lead to reluctance in 
considering theories of significant Eastern influences on 
Western religious thought. This resistance could contradict 
Occam's Razor, favoring simpler explanations. The challenge lies 
in using the lack of evidence as a reason to dismiss discussions 
about Buddhist-Christian links, especially when this absence 
might stem from the same unwillingness to explore these 
connections.



The teachings of Buddha, who noted the human tendency to easily 
recognize others' faults while overlooking one's own, find a 
parallel in Jesus' metaphor of noticing the splinter in 
another's eye but not the log in one’s own. This analogy raises 
a critical question about the introspective capacity of Western 
academia. Are scholars in the West, like their counterparts in 
other parts of the world, potentially influenced by their own 
cultural and emotional biases, thus hindering a more objective 
understanding of religious history?



For instance, the rise of the Hindutva movement in India and its 
impact on historical interpretation by Indian historians 
highlights the influence of political ideologies on academic 
research. This leads us to ponder whether Western academia, too, 
might be unconsciously shaped by its own cultural narratives and 
biases, thus affecting its openness to theories that challenge 
Eurocentric views of religious development.



This trend highlights a broader issue in Western religious 
scholarship: a hesitance to fully recognize external cultural 
influences. This tendency to perceive Western religious 
traditions as largely self-developed extends to underestimating 
the profound influence of Islamic science and culture on 
European thought. Such a Eurocentric perspective overlooks the 
rich tapestry of intercultural exchanges that have shaped 
civilizations.



*"...the task of theology (in 
the university) is to make us hold unto the object of 
faith...Jesus Christ, (who) goes before and lies outside the 
Biblical writings......"* Mogens "Menschensohn" Müller, 
leading Copenhagen professor of the New Testament, in Kristeligt 
Dagblad, 9-5-2014 - Quoted from Jesusisbuddha.com




In this context, 
it's pertinent to observe that the academic study of religion 
often presents a unique intersection where science and belief 
intermingle, perhaps more than is ideal. It's rare for atheists 
to deeply engage in religious studies, which may indicate that 
this field, striving for scientific legitimacy, often harbors 
scholars with inherent religious beliefs. This duality 
potentially influences their academic pursuits, unlike in fields 
like chemistry, where personal beliefs are less likely to 
intersect with scientific inquiry. Thus, in religious studies, 
scholars may find themselves navigating between scientific 
objectivity and personal faith.




This issue is crucial in 
historical and religious scholarship, where researchers' 
personal beliefs and cultural backgrounds could influence their 
interpretations, notably in the study of links between Buddhism 
and Christianity. Take, for example, 
[Paula 
Fredriksen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Fredriksen), a renowned historian in early Judaism and 
Christianity. Originally a Catholic, she later converted to 
Judaism. This aspect of her personal religious journey offers 
insight into her scholarly approach, particularly if her work 
reflects a denial of Eastern influences on early Christianity. 
It raises questions about whether such perspectives might be 
influenced by personal religious convictions.



Often, Western scholars question the link between Christianity 
and Buddhism, citing fundamental doctrinal differences. However, 
the interaction between 
[
Hinduism's Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism](Hinduism's%20Advaita%20Vedanta%20and%20Buddhism) 
demonstrates that significant differences in belief systems 
don't preclude mutual influence. These traditions, despite their 
distinct philosophies, have influenced each other, particularly 
in metaphysical and spiritual practices.



This suggests that historical and 
cultural exchanges between religions or philosophies can happen 
despite significant doctrinal differences. The evolution of 
religious and philosophical thought often involves a complex mix 
of adopting, adapting, and sometimes challenging elements from 
other systems. Thus, the argument that fundamental differences 
between Buddhism and Christianity negate the possibility of 
influence is not necessarily definitive. Exchange and adaptation 
of ideas can coexist with, or even arise because of these 
differences.



The prevalent dismissal of 
Buddhist influences on Jesus by Western scholars may furthermore 
stem from their general lack of proficiency in Sanskrit, Pali, 
and Tibetan, as well as a limited understanding of ancient Asian 
cultures.



How does one 
prove that something is a copy of something else? Surely, one 
must have the original as well as the copy at hand. Scholars 
have failed to identify Q (the primary source) simply because 
they did not consider reading MSV (M&ucirc;lasarvâstivâdavinaya) and 
SDP (Saddharmapundarîka)* 
in the original Sanskrit. It is as simple as that. - *
Lindtner, [
Jesusisbuddha.com](https://www.jesusisbuddha.com/CLT.html)



This gap in expertise suggests a 
need for a more open reception to the insights of specialists 
like Lindtner, who possess extensive knowledge in these areas, 
from language to history. Embracing such expertise could offer a 
more nuanced and comprehensive perspective on the historical 
interplay between these two great religious traditions.



The Silk Roads, as a nexus of intercultural exchange, played a 
crucial role in this process, facilitating a dynamic interchange 
of ideas, practices, and beliefs. They contributed significantly 
to our understanding of religious developments, including the 
ascetic elements within Christianity. As ideas and practices 
traversed cultures, they tended to evolve and amalgamate, 
forming hybrid traditions rather than direct transpositions.



Occam's Razor, which posits that the simplest explanation is 
often the correct one, would suggest that the extensive network 
of the Silk Roads naturally facilitated the exchange and 
adaptation of religious and cultural practices. It would be an 
oversimplification to assume that influences between East and 
West were unidirectional or that they did not significantly 
impact the religious and cultural landscapes they connected.



The responsibility of scholars, then, is to investigate why 
these major trade routes did not facilitate more apparent 
cultural exchanges, rather than merely attempting to prove a 
direct link. The absence of such a cultural interplay along 
these significant routes would be quite remarkable.



The pattern observed in Christian scholarship, where there's a 
tendency to deny or overlook Buddhist influence, appears to be 
repeating in the study of Greek influence in India. This 
suggests a recurring theme in historical research where the 
extent of intercultural influences is often underestimated or 
unacknowledged.

sculptural Indian styles of the Mauryan period.
The half-closed eyes, denoting a 
meditative state, are a common element in Buddhist 
representations, conveying inner tranquility and spiritual 
introspection. The forehead bears a third eye mark with three 
rings, suggesting a connection to the Buddhist trinity, the
[Borromean rings of 
TRi-RaTNaS](#Borromean_rings_of_Unity_). Her elongated earlobes, another hallmark of 
Buddha representations, denote wisdom and a departure from 
worldly possessions.
Notably, the sculpture includes a nose ring, an adornment that 
is not typically found in Greek art, suggesting a strong Indian 
cultural element. This detail adds to the overall synthesis of 
the figure, marrying local traditions with foreign influences. 
The nose ring could signify marital status, fashion, or even 
spiritual significance within Indian culture.
Additionally, the full lips, pronounced chin, and the sensual 
yet contemplative expression are reminiscent of Greek sculptural 
art, known for its realistic portrayal of human subjects. The 
combination of Hellenistic realism with Indian symbolism results 
in a sculpture that is both physically alluring and spiritually 
resonant.
This piece stands as a testament to the cultural dialogue 
facilitated by the Silk Road, where Greek realism met and melded 
with the spiritual iconography of Indian art.*




[Johanna 
Hanink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johanna_Hanink)'s interpretation 
of Greco-Buddhism as a reflection of European scholarly 
reluctance to acknowledge native contributions to the "pleasing 
proportions and elegant poses of sculptures from ancient 
Gandhara," as noted by 
[Michael 
Falser](https://uni-heidelberg.academia.edu/MFalser), challenges the 
notion of "Buddhist art with a Greek 'essence'" as a colonial 
construct emerging during British rule in India. This 
perspective, as it intersects with the depiction of the Indian 
woman, introduces a contentious angle in scholarly 
interpretation, where the debate shifts from religious bias to 
what could be perceived as left-wing political agendas. In this 
light, it's not merely old European colonial perspectives 
painting Indian art with Greek hues, but a modern inclination to 
dismantle our colonial history under a lens of guilt. These 
views, arguably 'woke,' represent another form of colonial 
imposition, marked by an unrecognized Western ignorance of 
Eastern history. This approach reframes cultural exchange as 
cultural appropriation, seen solely through the prism of power 
and dominance, further complicating our understanding of 
historical intercultural interactions



The above depiction's specific features is evidence of a direct representation of 
the cultural syncretism in the Seleucid Empire. This might 
suggest to scholars like Hanink or Falser that cultural 
intermingling was (and is) a complex, two-way process, with 
influences flowing in both directions, rather than a simple case 
of colonial imposition.



The overall environment of cultural synthesis provided by the 
Silk Roads created an atmosphere where similar spiritual 
expressions arose over thousands of kilometers. Thus, a more 
inclusive historical view recognizes the Silk Roads not just as 
trade routes but as channels for a dynamic cultural and 
religious dialogue that has shaped the world in more ways than 
is credited.



This perspective offers a valuable counterpoint to the 
traditional nation-centric view of historical development. The 
concept of "countries" as we understand them today is a 
relatively recent development in human history, and their 
borders have often been fluid and subject to change. In 
contrast, trade routes such as the Silk Roads predate many 
modern nations and have served as continuous channels for 
interaction and exchange for millennia.



In accordance, the coming text will view trade routes as 
cultural entities in their own right, fostering a level of 
cultural homogeneity that might surpass that of the countries 
they pass through. These routes acted as arteries of commerce, 
yes, but also of ideas, religions, languages, art, and 
technologies. As such, they could cultivate their own unique 
cultures, which were defined not by national borders but by the 
flow of goods and knowledge.



The Silk Roads as a Civilizational Zone

**The Silk Roads connected a series of civilizations from the 
Chinese Han Empire to the Mediterranean, creating a 
supercultural zone where East and West could meet and mingle in 
ways that transcended the political or cultural policies of any 
single empire or nation-state along its length. The result was a 
kind of Silk Road culture that, while not homogenous in the 
strictest sense, shared a set of common values, practices, and 
understandings shaped by the necessities of trade and the 
exchange of ideas.**


This perspective aligns with the concept of "cultural spheres" 
or "civilizational zones," where the defining characteristics of 
a region's culture are not determined by the political 
boundaries of states, but by the historical, geographical, and 
cultural ties that bind different peoples together. It suggests 
a view of history as a tapestry woven from threads of human 
interaction that are often far broader and more complex than 
national narratives allow for.



The adage "follow the money" aptly applies to the Silk Road's 
cultural dynamics. This ancient trade network fostered a shared 
civilizational experience marked by fluidity and openness to 
external influences, contrasting with the more rigid structures 
of nation-states. In this context, the cultures along the Silk 
Road prioritized connectivity and mutual influence, favoring a 
collective development over isolation and independent growth. 
This perspective underscores the significant role of trade and 
economic interactions in shaping cultural and historical 
landscapes.



ALEXANDER THE 
GREAT IN INDIA

The key influence in the 
ongoing construction of Buddhism was the introduction of Greek 
philosophy. Homer was translated into Indian languages, and the 
story of the Trojan Horse became part of the folklore on the 
Ganges plains.



However, the influence also went the other way, as far back as 
to Greece. Alexander the Great, in addition to his formidable 
military skills, was philosophically inclined. His father, 
Philip of Macedonia, brought Aristotle from Athens to tutor 
Alexander. Alexander chose prominent philosophers 
[Pyrrho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrho), 
[Anaxarchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaxarchus), 
and 
[Onesicritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onesicritus) 
to accompany him on his conquest of India.



The Cultural Openness of Alexander****
Generally, Greek culture was unimpressed and often disinterested 
in foreign philosophies and religions. Gods of other lands were 
traditionally understood not on their own terms but as locally 
adapted Greek gods. Thus, the Indian god Krishna became 
Hercules. From Aristotle's Macedonian-Greek perspective, 
barbarians, those who did not speak Greek, were lower beings 
whom the Greeks were meant to rule over. The idea of seeking 
philosophical inspiration outside Greece seemed unlikely.



**However, in this respect, it is of crucial importance to 
mention the following: Alexander did *not* follow his tutor 
Aristotle's opinions in this regard. The respect Alexander 
showed for Persian and Egyptian culture was almost heretical in 
this context, and this openness paved the way for Greek 
philosophers' unusual respect and attentiveness towards India's 
naked ascetics, whom the Greeks called gymnosophists. Where 
Greek philosophers often provoked disgust in other cultures for 
their tradition of philosophizing naked, they met in India's 
ascetics a culture that practiced the same form of philosophical 
nudity.**


Onesicritus and the sun's naked sages

**Onesicritus, a student of Diogenes, had remarkable 
encounters with Indian sages, the gymnosophists. In Taxila, he 
met a group of naked sages on a small hill in the scorching 
midday sun. Their demand for him to undress as a condition for 
discussion probably seemed familiar, as Greek philosophers also 
had the habit of discussing naked. The fact that Indian sages 
sat unimpressed in the burning sun and only wanted to discuss 
here earned Onesicritus' respect but was not alien to a man 
whose mentor was Diogenes in the barrel.**
Diogenes, as the archetype of the provocative holy fool who 
scornfully sat outside society's rules, would undoubtedly be 
recognized by India's wise men.

*This Bactrian terracotta figurine embodies the 
fusion of Hellenistic and indigenous artistic influences. The 
figure's posture and stylized wings echo Greek representations 
of deities and mythological figures, such as Eros or Nike. The 
facial features, with a prominent beard and detailed hair, 
resonate with the classical Greek style of portraying mature 
male figures, emphasizing individuality and expression. The 
craftsmanship and the figure's attire, including the drapery's 
folds, reveal a Hellenistic touch, a common trait in the 
region's iconography following Alexander the Great's incursion 
into Central Asia and the subsequent cultural syncretism.



The terra cotta figure from Bactria shares several parallels 
with depictions of Diogenes, the Greek philosopher: Cynic 
Philosophy Representation: Diogenes is often depicted in a 
simple cloak, embodying the Cynic philosophy of living in 
accordance with nature and rejecting material possessions. The 
figure's simple attire may reflect this philosophy. Ascetic 
Lifestyle: Diogenes was known for his ascetic lifestyle, which 
is also a common theme in Buddhist representations. The figure's 
modest clothing and humble posture could symbolize a similar 
asceticism. Beard and Hair: The detailed beard and hair are 
reminiscent of classical Greek depictions of philosophers, among 
whom Diogenes is one of the most iconic. Posture and Expression: 
Diogenes was famous for his provocative actions and disdain for 
societal norms. The seated posture and the facial expression of 
the figure, which could be interpreted as contemplative or 
challenging, might draw a parallel to Diogenes' own public 
demeanor. Wings: While Diogenes himself was not associated with 
wings, the Greek god Hermes was, and he was a messenger who 
traversed between the divine and mortal worlds. Diogenes' 
philosophy attempted to transcend conventional life, which could 
be symbolically represented by wings. These elements combined 
may suggest a fusion of Greek philosophical iconography with 
local Bactrian cultural motifs, portraying a figure that echoes 
the spirit of Diogenes in a new cultural context.*



Visiting the sacred city of 
Varanasi, one often meets Indian sadhus, modern embodiments of 
the ancient philosopher Diogenes. The terracotta figure, similar 
to numerous others, serves as a testament to these encounters. 
These interactions, where the lifestyles of Indian ascetics 
affirmed the principles of Diogenes, became ingrained in the 
cultural memory of both Greek and later European societies, 
honoring the wisdom of Indian gymnosophists. Subsequently, 
figures such as the English Puritans recognized these sages as 
precursors to their own ascetic practices.



Calanus - the army's sage****
There are many indirect indicators of this compatibility between 
Greek and Indian culture. That philosophers from the two 
cultures could meet in dialogue is perhaps natural, but even the 
ordinary soldier in Alexander's army could apparently 
respectfully recognize the Indian ascetic's lifestyle and value 
norms.



A naked sadhu from Taxila, named by the Greeks as 
[Calanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalanos), had 
just completed his obligatory 37 years as a hermit and was now 
free to do what he wanted. He joined Alexander and became a 
popular mascot for the army. Calanus became the army's guru, 
giving satsang, i.e., teaching officers and soldiers in the army 
his philosophy. The extent to which the army had taken the naked 
sadhu to their heart became clear when Calanus later decided to 
leave his body at the age of 79 in Susa, Persia, by burning 
himself alive in a dramatic ceremony, with Alexander and his 
entire army as spectators. As he was carried smiling into the 
flames, he was hailed by war cries and the trumpeting of 
elephants from Alexander's army. At this point, Calanus had 
become the army's spiritual guide, and his death was later taken 
by the army as a sign of Alexander's own too early death.



Considering the abundance of similar small terracotta figures 
discovered in Afghanistan, it is plausible to speculate that the 
depicted sadhu may represent Calanus.



Clearchus

**The philosopher 
[
Clearchus of Soli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearchus_of_Soli), probably a student of Aristotle, traveled 
with wisdom from Delphi to Oxus in India and later described in 
his pamphlets philosophical duels between Greek philosophers and 
Indian sages, where he let Indian wisdom triumph over the Greek.**


India's remembrance of Alexander

**India has always understood itself through myths, through 
stories.**
Even today in India, there are many folk tales about Alexander, 
especially his interest in India's philosophers, the wise 
sadhus.



To what extent Alexander's presence has influenced India can 
also be glimpsed through these still-living stories. I spent 
almost a year in the Indian state of Punjab, where it struck me 
how much the meeting with Alexander is still remembered by the 
people. In Punjab, I heard a man put another in his place by 
saying:* In the end, you are no more worth than one of Porus's 
elephants.* King Porus's elephant army was immediately 
defeated by Alexander upon his entry into India in 326.




THE SELEUCID EMPIRE

**In the period following Alexander the Great's death, the 
Seleucid Empire, which encompassed much of the former Persian 
Empire, played a pivotal role in the cultural exchange between 
Hellenism and Buddhism. It was founded by
[ 
Seleucus Nicator I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_I_Nicator) (358 – 281 BC), a distinguished general 
of Alexander. **


The Seleucid Openness ****
In noting the unique approach of Seleucus I Nicator, one of 
Alexander's successors, it's crucial to recognize his 
continuation of Alexander's 'un-Greek' respect and openness 
towards 'barbarians', conditional on their submission to his 
rule.




Seleucus I Nicator was among the few generals of Alexander who 
supported Alexander's deliberate policy of cultural 
amalgamation. This policy notably included the mass forced 
marriage of his officer corps to women from ocupied countries, 
especially from Persia, but later also from India. Remarkably, 
Seleucus' own marriage with the
[Sogdian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sogdia) noble 
woman, [Apama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apama), 
was one of the few such cross-cultural unions that survived 
Alexander's death.



This successful marriage set the 
tone for a Seleucid realm that was politically and militarily 
aggressive, but exceptionally tolerant in terms of cultural 
diversity. The son born from this mixed marriage, Antiochus I, 
was fully recognized by his father and played a significant role 
as a conciliator between the Persian elite and the emerging 
Hellenistic ruling class.



The Unique Geopolitical 
Conditions of the Seleucid Empire

**The Seleucid Empire, in terms of sheer longitudinal span, 
was one of the most elongated empires of the ancient world. It 
stretched over 3,000 kilometers from the Aegean Sea in the west 
to the Indus Valley in the east, creating a vast territory that 
connected the Greek world with the rich cultures of the Near and 
Middle East and Central Asia.




The Seleucid Empire was known for its extraordinary religious 
tolerance and cultural openness. Stretching from India to 
Turkey, this empire provided a unique melting pot where diverse 
religious and cultural ideas could intermingle, potentially 
including the philosophical and spiritual tenets of Buddhism and 
early Christianity. As depicted in the accompanying map, it is 
quite apt to view the Seleucid Empire not just as a political 
entity but as a massive trading route in itself. The Empire 
acted as a bridge between the East and West, facilitating the 
flow of goods, cultures, ideas, and technologies across its vast 
expanse. It connected the Hellenistic world with the societies 
of Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent.

**The Challenge of Ruling a Wast Territory

**Unlike
[
Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom), another of Alexander's generals who took control of 
Egypt—a small but fertile part of Alexander's legacy—Seleucus 
faced entirely different challenges. He ruled over a vast 
territory that united diverse cultures including Sumer, Elam, 
Persia, Assyria, Phoenicia, Babylon, and later Asia Minor and 
Palestine. This required an exceptional ability and willingness 
to collaborate culturally. **


No Seleucid Racial and Ethnic Exclusivity

**This reflects why Cleopatra, who was of entirely Macedonian 
origin, contrasts with the rulers of the Seleucid Empire, who 
were an amalgamation of various cultures and ethnicities. This 
diversity among the Seleucid rulers highlights their openness to 
different backgrounds, differing from the more ethnically 
homogeneous leadership in other post-Alexandrian geographically 
much smaller empires. **


Contrary to other post-Alexandrian empires, such as Ptolemaic 
Egypt, the Seleucid Empire did not have a racial exclusivity 
built into the highest echelons of its power structure. In this 
way, it continued Alexander's ingenious policy—a blend of 
localized feudalism and meritocratic governance. This approach 
allowed anyone, regardless of their non-Macedonian origin, to 
join the ranks of the powerful, provided they had earned it 
through merit or were of noble birth. However, a prerequisite 
for membership in this new elite circle was a mastery of the 
Greek language and culture. **



**Polis Cultures on a String from 
India to Greece

**Recognizing that he couldn't consolidate his power solely by 
relying on pre-existing cities, Seleucus Nicator opted to build 
numerous new cities from scratch. These cities were vibrant 
centers of Hellenistic polis culture, infused with 
Macedonian-Greek traditions and civilization. Positioned like 
pearls on a string, they also served as caravanserais and linked 
India to the Middle East in a cultural exchange that lasted long 
after the collapse of the Seleucid Empire and its Bactrian and 
Indo-Greek successors. **


Cultural Diffusion and Legacy in the Seleucid Empire

**In the various Alexandrias and newly-founded Seleucias that 
dotted the landscape of the Seleucid Empire, Hellenistic culture 
became a marker of social capital. Speaking Greek and venerating 
Greek gods were not just exercises in spirituality or 
communication; they became synonymous with power and prosperity. 
Local indigenous groups and their leaders, even those situated 
far from the traditional Greek heartland, adopted the Greek 
language and partook in Greek theatrical productions as a form 
of cultural assimilation that had direct social and economic 
benefits.**



A Second Wave of Hellenistic Migration

**The formation of the Seleucid Empire facilitated a second 
wave of migration, distinct from the initial military 
expeditions. This time, the people who set out for new lands 
were not just soldiers but commoners—artisans, scribes, 
philosophers, and scientists from Macedonia and Greece. Their 
journey for a better life in the newly-established cities of the 
Seleucid Empire echoes the 19th-century mass migration to 
America. These new settlers left an indelible, albeit often 
overlooked, imprint on the cultural and intellectual landscape 
of the East.**


The Seleucid experiment in cultural fusion had long-lasting 
implications, not just in terms of the flow of goods along the 
burgeoning trade routes, but also in the spread of ideas and 
traditions. It became a vibrant hub of cultural exchange, laying 
the foundation for future civilizations to build upon.



The Seleucid Empire seen as a Civilizational Zone

**Examining historical examples, the 
[Seleucid 
Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire) emerges as a key illustration of the civilizational 
zones concept. This empire, a confluence of diverse languages 
and cultures, demonstrates the intricate dynamics of cultural 
and historical evolution in vast empires. Analysis of the 
Seleucid Empire through the lens of civilizational zones 
highlights how varied cultural and linguistic groups were 
unified and interacted under its expansive rule, weaving an 
intricate tapestry of interconnected histories. **


Intriguingly, within this context, a form of abstract universal 
goodness, akin to Buddhist principles, emerged as the lingua 
franca, facilitating cohesion and communication across this vast 
empire, and exemplifying the significant role of shared 
philosophical and ethical frameworks in the unification of large 
and diverse territories.



THE MAURYAN EMPIRE

**In India itself, the rise of power centers during the 
contemporary Mauryan dynasty led to the creation of wealthy 
Gangetic mega-cities. This urbanization necessitated, like the 
case was in the Seleucid Empire, a state capable of overseeing 
long-distance trade and production. Elements of the warrior 
caste evolved into a new state caste, focused on the 
ever-growing need to regulate trade and infrastructure.



![](/images/Maurya_Empire,_c.250_BCE.png)



**Chandragupta Maurya: India's 
Great Low-Caste King

**[
Chandragupta Maurya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandragupta_Maurya) (340-298 BCE), the grandfather of
[Ashoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka), was a 
man of humble origins, born into the *
[shudra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shudra)*, 
the lowest caste in the societal hierarchy. Alongside
[Chanakya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanakya), a
[Brahmin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin) who 
felt betrayed by his own caste, Chandragupta orchestrated a 
social revolution that dethroned the preceding 
[Nanda 
dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanda_Empire). This marked the inception of the formidable
[Mauryan 
empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurya_Empire).**


The Seleucid ambassador 
[Megasthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megasthenes) 
meticulously documented the Mauryan dynasty around 300 BCE while 
residing at Chandragupta's court in the capital, Pataliputra—now 
modern-day Patna, in the Indian state of Bihar.




Chandragupta's rise to power coincided with Alexander the 
Great's arrival in Northwestern India in 326 BCE. Ancient 
historians recount that Dhana Nanda, the ruler of the Nanda 
dynasty, was despised in his own country for his low birth. 
Alexander received emissaries from the disgruntled Brahmin caste 
who offered assistance in overthrowing Dhana Nanda. However, 
Alexander had to abandon his conquest plans when his own army 
rebelled against marching further into India.




Both the Nanda and Maurya dynasties were led by individuals from 
the lower rungs of the Indian caste system. It is plausible to 
consider these low-caste dynasties as products of the social 
chaos induced by the affluent cities along the Ganges and 
Alexander's military disruption of the North-western region of 
India.



Chandragupta's encounter with Alexander's campaign was pivotal. 
The prevalence of both the Nanda and Mauryan dynasties 
underscored how the emergence of Buddhism coincided with a 
period of social upheaval that especially disrupted the 
established caste system.



The Persian Legacy

**For thousands of years, Persian culture has exerted a 
significant impact on Northern India. The formidable Persian 
Empire repeatedly extended its reach into the northwestern 
regions of the Indian subcontinent. A testament to this 
influence is the very name 'India' itself, which derives from 
the Persian inability to pronounce the letter 's,' transforming 
'Sindh,' a province in what is now Pakistan, into 'Hindh.' This 
linguistic adaptation gave rise to the terms 'Hindustan' and 
'Hindus,' underscoring the depth of Persian cultural imprint on 
India.**


Northern India, particularly in the period just before the rise 
of the Mauryan dynasty, received significant civilizational 
inputs from the most powerful empire of the time, the
[
Achaemenid Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire). The Persians utilized the social 
fragmentation of the caste system to efficiently divide and 
conquer. It is reasonable to speculate that the low-caste kings 
like Chandragupta received aid from Achaemenid Persia, which 
sought buffer states along its eastern borders.



Chandragupta's realm was situated in what is today the state of 
Bihar, a region that has retained a stronger Persian influence 
than any other Indian states, an influence that is still evident 
today.



Chandragupta and Chanakya's military strength could only have 
originated from Persian military forces, particularly the 
fragmented units that roamed into India during the chaos 
following both Alexander's conquests and later his death.



Once Chandragupta had consolidated power, he modeled his 
governance after Persian prototypes, even positioning himself as 
an Indian replica of a Persian king. Numerous examples 
illustrate the Mauryan dynasty's flirtation with Persian 
culture. Chandragupta even had a cadre of female Amazonian 
warriors, much like his Persian contemporaries. Early 
administrative scripts in India also owe a debt to Achaemenid 
Persia. Chandragupta's palaces were also constructed in 
accordance with Persian prototypes. Reflecting on the ruins of 
the Mauryan palaces in Patna, Rowland notes:



*"The first indication of the 
tremendous influence exerted on Mauryan India by the art of the 
Achaemenid Empire ... the conscious adoption of the Iranian 
palace plan by the Mauryas was only part of the paraphernalia of 
imperialism imported from the West."*



We might surmise that 
Chandragupta, being an outsider to the Indian caste system, felt 
little obligation to continue the cultural traditions of his 
predecessors, making it easier for him to build his ideology and 
power structure from an eclectic perspective.



Thus, Chandragupta Maurya was not just a great king who ascended 
from the lowest echelons of society; he was a transformative 
figure whose rule was significantly influenced by external 
cultures, particularly Persia, which allowed him to challenge 
and overturn the traditional caste hierarchies in India. This 
overturn pawed the way for long-distance trade and urban life to 
flourish.



THE MAURYAN-SELEUCID PEACE AGREEMENT

**An important condition for the caravaic expansion was the 
good relations between the Seleucid and the Mauryan empire. 
Following Alexander the Great's conquests, the Seleucid Empire, 
among the most influential successors, adopted a strategy of 
guardedness towards the west but showed an inviting openness 
towards the east. It's in this eastern realm that they 
encountered the Mauryan Empire. **


****
The unique survival strategy of the Seleucid Empire hinged on 
Seleucus I Nicator's remarkable ability—honed in the days of 
Alexander the Great—to build cultural bridges which again 
translated into trading bridges. The turning point for the 
empire's destiny was its encounter with India. Originally 
beginning as a military confrontation in 305 BCE, it evolved 
into a harmonious cultural exchange with the powerful Maurya 
Dynasty. As a symbol of peace and friendship, Seleucus arranged 
the marriage of his daughter to Chandragupta Maurya, forming an 
alliance that would last for generations. In this exchange, 
Seleucus ceded territories up to the Hindu Kush mountains, while 
receiving 500 war elephants in return. These elephants later 
proved to be a decisive force in the pivotal 
[Battle 
of Ipsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ipsus) 
in Turkey in 301 BCE. The Seleucid strategy henceforth involved 
peace towards the east and war to the west.



Chandragupta, aligned with the social openness of Seleucus 
Nicator, granted Greeks in Kandahar the right to marry into any 
Indian caste, highlighting a softened stance towards the 
Brahminical caste system during the Mauryan period.



The peace treaty had a profound 
impact on the later rise of the Ashokan-Mauryan Dynasty as the 
world's first and largest "peace empire." Shielded by his 
Macedonian friends to the northwest, Ashoka could safely convert 
his empire to the non-violence of Buddhism, even implementing 
laws for animal welfare. Without the predeceding Seleucid-Maurya 
alliance, Ashoka's benevolent rule and the expansion of Buddhism 
would have been impossible.



The Mauryan Openness versus the Exclusiveness of the Brahmans

**The Brahmans, traditional custodians of Indian knowledge, 
exhibited a reluctance to engage with foreign cultures, as 
captured by Sir William Jones' observation that the Brahmans 
seldom borrowed from Greeks or Arabs:



*The Brahmans are always too proud to borrow 
their 
**
science from the Greeks, Arabs or any nation of the

Mlechchas as they call those who are ignorant of the Vedas.* 

Yet, the cultural panorama had 
changed in India under the Mauryan Empire. Brahmins were loosing 
power. Chandragupta Maurya, having interacted with Alexander's 
Greeks, appreciated Hellenistic influences. His disruptive 
Persian ouview together with his lower cast background pawed the 
way for curiosity and social experimantation. Chandragupta's 
religious outview was furthermore rooted in Janism, an Indian 
minority religion that lived outside the laws' of 
[Manu's cast 
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manusmriti).




At the previous mentioned peace agreement in 305 B.C., 
Chandragupta's acquisition of territory up to Hindu Kush, also 
incuded the annexation of the Greek city of Alexandria Arachosia 
(modern-day Kandahar or Gandhara in Persian) Chandragupta 
allowed it to flourish under Hellenistic ideals.



Cultural Synthesis

**The Seleucid-Indian friendship led to the flow of Indian 
wisdom into the Seleucid Empire, while Hellenistic wisdom 
enriched Northwestern India. In this cross-cultural melting pot, 
new Greco-Indian syncretic religions began to emerge, most 
notably Buddhist culture blending harmoniously with Hellenism. 
**
Kandahar became an important center of cultural fusion. This 
city and the smaller cities around it, rich in Hellenistic art 
and architecture, became significant nexuses between Indian and 
Hellenistic culture.



Lasting Impact from the first Seleucid-Indian Alliance

**The Mauryan ethos, free from the constraints of caste, 
readily imbibed Hellenistic influences, as seen in evolving 
Indian statuary and art. Centuries after Alexander, Greek 
statues of Zeus, Odysses and Pericles were seen alongside 
various depictions of Buddha and Indian Gods.**


The cross-cultural friendship ensured that the Mauryan Dynasty 
would maintain a cordial diplomatic relationship with the 
Seleucid Empire. Seleucus sent an ambassador named
[Megasthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megasthenes) 
to Chandragupta's court in Pataliputra. Successive Mauryan 
rulers like 
[Bindusara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bindusara) 
and Ashoka continued these diplomatic relations through exchange 
of ambassadors.



Though the sprawling Seleucid Empire was eventually replaced by 
a series of smaller Greek states, the original Greek-Indian 
alliance significantly shaped the region from India to the 
Middle East for centuries.



ASHOKA THE GREAT

**It is indeed remarkable how the influence of one of the 
world's largest empires has been overlooked in Western 
historiography. Only the author H.G. Wells seems to afford
[Ashoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka) the 
recognition he deserves, stating:



"His (Ashoka's) 
reign for eight-and-twenty years was one of **
the brightest interludes in the troubled history of mankind."



In the era preceding the end of 
the Punic Wars, which heralded the rise of the mighty Roman 
Empire, and after Macedonia had lost its leading role with the 
death of Alexander the Great, a new and powerful India emerged. 
This resurgence was fueled by flourishing trade, skilled 
craftsmanship, and agriculture.



**[Ashoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka), 
the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, is revered as one of the 
greatest and most enlightened rulers in Indian history. His 
reign marks the zenith of the Mauryan dynasty. Initially known 
as "Ashoka the Terrible" in his impetuous youth, he was a 
ruthless warlord who expanded his territory while orchestrating 
a brutal campaign against Brahmins and Buddhists alike. The 
bounty for a severed head of a Brahmin was a staggering 100 
dinars.**


However, Ashoka underwent a profound transformation after 
converting to Buddhism. His rule brought peace, order, and 
systematic governance to a vast Indian empire that stretched 
from southern India to Burma in the east and as far west as the 
eastern parts of Persia.



Following a period of extreme violence, including the 
devastating [
Kalinga war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalinga_War), Ashoka's empire metamorphosed into the world's 
first humanitarian superstate. He crafted a realm that thrived 
through wisdom and moral authority rather than the force of the 
sword.



Ashoka's governance followed a pattern that would later become a 
historical archetype for warlords who, after
[
consolidating their power, ushered in long periods of peace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebRpquKFSEw) 
and prosperity.Inheriting the Mauryan dynasty's liberal 
policies, inspired by Persian governance, Ashoka allowed social 
mobility based on merit, rather than caste or religious 
affiliation. While the caste system remained in place, it lost 
the rigidity that characterized it before and after this period 
in Indian history. Ashoka's transformative reign remains a 
pivotal chapter in Indian history, highlighting the enduring 
impact of ethical leadership and the unifying power of shared 
humanitarian values.



Long-distance Infrastructure

**A key factor in the rise and consolidation of this expansive 
empire was the construction of an elaborate network of roads. 
These roads acted as the lifeblood of the empire, connecting 
India's multi-ethnic and multicultural tapestry into a cohesive 
unit.**



In this period the trade routes expanded to such an extent that 
it became impossible to guard them against attacks through state 
governed policing power. Ashoka 'realized' that control over the 
mind is much more efficient than control over the body when it 
comes down to the securing of peace in inter-dependent trading 
mega-cities. Hence Buddhism became suitable as a state religion.




The Rise of 
Ashoka-Buddhism

**Before Ashoka, Buddha was regarded as not much more than a 
local hero among hundred other saints on the Gangetic plains. 
However, under Ashoka's reign, Buddhism entered an unprecedented 
period of expansion. Despite its limited spread and influence in 
the first few centuries after Buddha, it wasn't until Ashoka's 
conversion to Buddhism around 250 BCE that this religion gained 
significant momentum. This momentum eventually propelled 
Buddhism into becoming one of the world's major religions. **


During this period Buddhism transformed into a pragmatic state 
religion. The individual quest for Nirvana took a backseat to a 
state-sponsored moral doctrine. This doctrine was particularly 
tailored for the prosperous city-dwellers, merchants and 
artisans, keeping in mind the diverse feudal mini-states that 
made up most of India at the time.



With Ashoka's conversion, a global dissemination of the 
revolutionary and still-relevant teachings of the Buddha began. 
Ashoka initiated a large-scale missionary effort based on 
Buddha's own call for spreading the faith, a mission anchored in 
the power of example:



"*Oh Monks! Travel far and wide 
to benefit many, out of compassion for the world, for the 
advantage of gods and mortals alike. And let not two of you take 
the same route. Preach the doctrine that leads to goodness. 
Preach it in spirit and in letter. Show through your own 
immaculate lives how religious life ought to be lived.*" 
(Buddha)



![](/images/Ashokasmission.jpg)


*Buddhism's missionary routes*



In Ashoka's version of missionary 
Buddhism, the focus lay on practical tenets for everyday living 
rather than intricate philosophical discourse or deification of 
the Buddha. The teachings emphasized the essence of the 
philosophy over the personage of the Buddha himself.



The Universities of Taxila and Nalanda

**During Ashoka's peaceful reign, the early formations of 
university culture began to surface. Taxila, a city that 
flourished in this period, became a global center for 
intellectual thought. Frequently referenced in 
[
Buddhist Jataka tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jataka_tales#Jātakas_in_art_and_culture), Taxila exemplifies how intellectual 
and spiritual ideas managed to permeate all levels of society. 
The city symbolized the inclusiveness of Buddhism under Ashoka, 
uniting elite and commoner through shared spiritual practices. 
Similarly, Nalanda University in the vicinity of Patna would 
later take up the torch, profoundly shaping Buddhism even up to 
the Gupta era.**


The Ashokan Pillars

**Inspired by Persian aesthetics, Ashoka erected towering 15-meter 
sandstone pillars across his kingdom. Some were adorned with 
four lion heads symbolically **
proclaiming the Buddha's teachings of Dharma in all directions. 
These pillars were engraved with easily digestible moral 
principles, as encapsulated in Ashoka Pillar Edict Nb2 (S. 
Dharmika):



*"Dharma is good,
but what 
constitutes Dharma?
It includes little evil, much good, kindness, 


generosity, truthfulness and purity."
*Ashoka Pilar Edict Nb2 (S. 
Dharmika)



In an unprecedented move, Ashoka 
also had his edicts inscribed in impeccable Greek, targeting 
regions under Hellenistic control.



![](/images/sarnath_Lion_Capital_of_Ashoka.jpg)



No Personality Cult****
Ashoka's edicts made no mention of Buddha, and there wasn't a 
single statue of Buddha from that time. The edicts emphasized 
practical life rules rather than theology. With the combined 
force of Ashoka's visionary Buddhism and the state's power, what 
might be termed the world's first secular state was born.



The state adopted a rational form of Buddhism, viewing it as an 
"enlightened" means of socio-spiritual regulation for life along 
trade routes and within cities. The growth of trade routes 
depended on wast geographic higway shaped areas of peace and 
trust, for without them, long distance trading caravans, often 
traversing hundred of kilometers without sufficient policing 
infrastucture risked robbery and collapse.



Emperor Ashoka, a paramount figure in the proliferation of 
Buddhism, is credited with the establishment of 84,000 stupas 
and a multitude of monasteries across his empire, strategically 
placed within bustling trade hubs to maximize their influence 
and accessibility. This monumental effort was not confined to 
his domain alone; evidence of such Buddhist structures extends 
as far as Persia and even Syria. Theravada texts from Sri Lanka 
notably mention a significant presence of Buddhist monastic 
communities in Syria, indicating the widespread reach of 
Buddhism during this period. This cross-cultural expansion 
reflects the far-reaching impact of Ashoka's missionary 
endeavors, disseminating Buddhist teachings well beyond the 
Indian subcontinent.




The Spread of Ashoka-Buddhism

**Edicts on pillars, stupas, academic institutions, and 
state-endorsed monasteries and missionaries, all played a part 
in the spread of Ashoka's practical moral teachings. This ethos 
of self-regulation was gently impressed upon both the caravan 
travelers and urban dwellers alike. Under Ashoka's guidance, 
Buddhism flourished, contributing to what could be considered 
the emergence of the world's inaugural secular governance. It 
became the civilizational adhesive that united a diverse 
populace, facilitating trade and communal harmony across vast 
expanses.**


In this sense,
Ashokan monasteries were not just religious retreats; they were 
training grounds for self-discipline, while the wandering monks 
were the deliverers of moral guidance. Ashoka's interpretation 
of Buddhism provided a progressive blueprint for complex 
long-distance societal organization, promoting sustained trade 
and urban collaboration. In the era of Ashoka, monasteries 
became centers for cultivating discipline, and Buddhist monks 
emerged as devilery men of the 'dharmic interface'.



Ashoka's 'Buddhification' of Hellenistic Rulers

**Under Ashoka's reign, the intermingling of Greek and Indian 
philosophies reached unparalleled heights. Notably, some of 
Ashoka's first converts to Buddhism were **
his Macedonian-Greek neighbors in the Northwestern regions.



Although Western history often understates this, Hellenistic 
rulers possibly leaned towards, or even embraced, Buddhist 
tenets. The 13th Edict by S. Dhammika lists several Greek kings, 
with precise historical and geographical references, as 
proponents or followers of Buddhism:



[
Antiochus II Theos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_II_Theos), 261–246 BC - Seleucid Empire

[
Ptolemy II Philadelphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_II_Philadelphus), 285–247 BC - Egypt

Antigonus Gonatas, 276–239 BC - Macedonia

Magas, 288–258 BC - Cyrenaica, current-day Libya

Alexander II, 272–255 BC - Epirus, Northwestern Greece



While it's possible that Ashoka may have embellished the extent 
of these monarchs' conversions, the actual process of adopting 
Buddhism during that period did not require elaborate rituals. 
Therefore, it is likely that the said kings merely endorsed or 
showed favor towards Buddhist tenets. This, however, underscores 
the notable interactions and cultural exchanges between the 
far-flung eastern and western boundaries of the vast Seleucid 
Empire. A critical takeaway is that, even if Ashoka's claims 
about the spread of Buddhistic conversion to distant regions 
like Macedonia and Greece were overstated, Buddhist ways of 
thinking were nonetheless recognized in these lands.



Considering the non-aggressive and broadly relatable essence of 
its teachings, it is plausible to deduce that Buddhism cast a 
significant sway far beyond its core region. To employ a 
contemporary metaphor, Buddhism functioned akin to open-source 
spiritual-behavioral software, notable for its remarkable 
capacity to be tailored,customized, by its adherents.



THE GRECO-BACTRIAN KINGDOM AND THE BUDDHIST KING MEANDER

**The Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, dating from around 256 to 125 
BCE, was located in what is now Afghanistan, as well as parts of 
modern-day Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The climate of 
this region during the time of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was, 
backed by indirect evidence, likely more hospitable and fertile 
than it is today, which would have supported the kingdom’s 
immense prosperity. **


Around the time of the fall of the Maurya Dynasty in 190 BC, the 
Seleucid Empire began to slowly disintegrate, primarily due to 
conflicts with the emerging Parthian Empire. Interestingly, the 
Parthians adopted the Greek culture they observed in the 
Seleucids. Even after the fragmentation of the Seleucid Empire, 
the eastern satrap-kings maintained a good relationship with the 
Mauryan Dynasty. The Bactrian satrap, before its independence in 
255 BC and which represented the easternmost part of the 
Seleucid Empire, had particularly strong ties with neighboring 
India.



![](/images/greco-Bactria.jpg)



In 245 BCE, Diodotus I, a 
Greek-Macedonian king, broke away from the Seleucid Empire to 
establish his own state, Bactria. Concentrated with Greeks and 
Macedonians, this region became a destination for political 
exiles, much like Australia for England and Siberia for Russia. 
Bactria continued and deepened the friendly relationship with 
India, while focusing on defending against the constant 
invasions from nomadic tribes to the north and northwest.



Subsequently, the King of the newly founded Bactrian kingdom, 
[Menander 
(Melinda)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menander_I) 
(r. 160-135 BC), emerged as one of the most
[
renowned converts to Buddhism](https://medium.com/@thanos.matanis/the-yona-ka-a28179ecca2c). 
Ruling around 150 BC, he governed 
a territory spanning from Bactria (modern-day Afghanistan) to 
parts of what is now northwestern India.

It is critical to highlight that the Buddhism Menander embraced 
was significantly influenced by Hellenistic culture, having 
undergone nearly a century of cultural interchange.

Gem (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha) in Buddhism.*

During Menander's Greco-Buddhist 
era, the Indo-Greek cultural synthesis reached an unprecedented 
zenith. Notably, many valuable Indo-Greek artifacts in silver 
and gold have been excavated. This, combined with the exquisite 
coinage—which artistically surpasses even that of 
Greece—indicates societies of great prosperity.



![](/images/Menander.jpg)


*Portrait of King Meander/Melinda from a coin*



Meander's predecessor, Demetrius I, had around 184 BC embarked 
on a bold conquest deep into India. Here he founded the Indo 
Greek Kingdom, where the Greeks even reached the new 
[Sunga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunga_Empire) 
stronghold in 
[Pataliputra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pataliputra).



![](/images/IndoGreekKingdom.jpg)



After this Eastern expansion 
[Taxila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxila) became 
the new nexus for Greco-Buddhist religion and art. The outcome 
of this conquest was that approximately 30, often rivaling, 
Greek minor kings later settled and ruled in the Punjab region 
that is now bith in Pakistan and India, continuing until about 
50 AD. Many of these kings converted to or were sympatic towards 
Buddhism. Little would be known about them if not for the 
high-quality coins they left behind.

The Lingua Franca of the Mudras

**As diverse cultures intersected along the Silk Roads, the 
barrier of spoken language was significant. However, the silent 
language of the Buddha's hand gestures, or mudras, provided a 
common ground. Travelers and traders, often confronted with 
stupas, also encountered the ubiquitous depictions of the 
Buddha, whose mudras transcended linguistic divides. These hand 
gestures evolved into a form of universal communication, 
enabling the exchange of Buddhist stories and teachings across a 
mosaic of cultures.**
It is certainly plausible that travelers on the Silk Roads could 
have adopted a simplified form of mudra-inspired sign language 
to convey peaceful intentions and other basic concepts to one 
another. Given that the mudras were widely recognized symbols 
associated with peace and spiritual ideals due to their 
connection with Buddhism, they could have served as a basis for 
a rudimentary, non-verbal means of communication. This form of 
sign language would have facilitated basic peace assurances 
among people of different languages and cultures, promoting 
mutual understanding and cooperation in the diverse environment 
of the Silk Roads.



Buddha's Aspirations and Civilizational Impact

**Indeed, the Buddha's intent was not the construction of 
grand civilizations. Yet, his profound insights and doctrines 
undoubtedly assisted Emperor Ashoka in nurturing and advancing 
the expansive civilization along the Ganges, and its influence 
extended even further.



**
Buddhism's Middle Path as a 
Cultural Modus Operandi

**Through the rich cultural exchange, the Buddhist Middle Path 
transcended its spiritual origins to become a behavioral 
standard for the burgeoning merchant classes, from the Far East 
to the Middle East. This ethical framework likely extended along 
a buffer zone surrounding major trade arteries, influencing and 
being practiced by communities within this radius. The teachings 
of the Buddha on moderation began to shape a collective 
consciousness, fostering a culture of restraint that was crucial 
for peaceful, long-range trade.**


Mind Control instead of Military Control

**Instead of securing the trading routes and cities with 
military power, Ashoka built self-control interfaces in the form 
stupas and monasteries, not in faraway places but as close to 
ordinary social life as possible where it could have a direct 
impact on the ground reality. **


Non-violence and Wealth

**Wealth based on global trade and not localized farming is 
always met with the challenge of synchronizing different 
cultures living far away from each other. Without a common 
denominator, trade is not possible. With the rise of the new 
globally connected urban megacentres on the Gangetic plain, 
Buddhism evolved as an understanding of reality that could unite 
people of different casts, creeds, and cultures in both urban 
and 'caravanic' self-control. Here the feudal Brahmanistic cast 
fragmentation would not be able to make ends meet. Hence 
Buddhism evolved into a self-restraining and peace-producing 
Buddha-belt from East to West. Without religious implemented 
self-control, the long-distance silk routes would as mentioned, 
collapse into banditry, and without the same, people of 
different colors, creeds, and languages would not be able to 
co-exist in big cities and in the caravanserais placed along the 
caravan routes. **


East-end Buddhism and West-end Cristianity

**The influence of Ashokan Buddhism is reflected in the 
Western emergence of Christianity. With the decline of the Roman 
Empire's military prowess, Christianity rose as the predominant 
ideology for self-regulation in the West. Emperor Constantine's 
transition from a focus on military might to a reliance on 
religious governance echoes Ashoka's own shift from a policy of 
aggression to one of religiously inspired self-discipline. While 
such parallel developments at each end of a major trade route 
could potentially arise independently as a response to the needs 
of trade-driven societies, it seems improbable that the 
extensive network and open nature of the Silk Road's 
civilizational zone did not contribute to a cross-cultural 
religious exchange of ideas. These ideas likely shared a common 
thread of non-violence as a foundational principle for the 
prosperity and stability of civilizations.



**From Elitarian Jainism to the 
Mass-religion of Buddhism

**In India itself Ashoka's propagation of Buddhist doctrines 
extended the already present spiritual principle of non-violence 
beyond the confines of ascetic life. It's noteworthy that 
Ashoka's grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, despite his 
multicultural engagements, embraced Jainism—an elitarian faith that holds 
non-violence (Ahimsa) as its cardinal tenet. Viewing it through 
the lens of inherited cultural values, it seems plausible that 
Ashoka's universal and less personal form of Buddhism was 
effectively a democratization of the more exclusive, upper-class 
Jainism prevalent within his own lineage. The stringent Jain 
adherence to non-violence was thus tempered and evolved into a 
core ethos for a peaceful civilizational zone, fostering an 
expansive cultural sphere of peace.



The elite practice of non-violence 
and loving-kindness in North-west India had been established 
long before Ashoka, but under his reign, it became a philosophy 
accessible to all. In this light, one might consider Ashoka 
Buddhism as a form of 'Jainism light'—a more approachable 
version of the ancient doctrine. **


An illustrative example that encapsulates both the parallels and 
divergences between Jainism and Buddhism can be seen in their 
respective monastic initiation rites. Jain monks undertake the 
austere practice of manually plucking their hair out, a symbol 
of renunciation, while Buddhist monks are permitted to shave 
their heads, reflecting a less extreme approach. Similarly, in 
Jainism, the act of *
[Sallekhana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallekhana)*—fasting 
to death—is regarded as a noble end, whereas Buddhism prescribes 
moderation, allowing only for periodic fasting.



The Middle Way: A Foundational Principle for Civilizational 
Harmony

**Buddhism's emphasis on moderation, epitomized by the Middle 
Way, is a guiding principle that advocates for balance and 
avoidance of extremes. This ethos resonates profoundly with the 
essence of the Silk Road, which can be viewed as a physical 
embodiment of Buddha's Middle Way. In this context, the Middle 
Way transcends its spiritual origins to become a foundational 
philosophy for mass civilization. It represents an early and 
significant attempt to instill self-control within the human 
psyche, promoting harmony and stability across diverse societies 
interconnected by the Silk Road. (This theme will be further 
explored in the chapter 


[Civilization and Consciousness 
Part II](/civilization/civilization-and-consciousness-ii).)**


The Transition from Buddhism to Christianity

**Several centuries subsequent to the rise of Buddhism, the 
teachings of Jesus would resonate with a comparable ethos of 
non-violence at the western extremity of the Silk Roads. It is 
noteworthy that the dominant religious milieu in Jesus' native 
land did not inherently foster an attitude of 'turning the other 
cheek' in response to aggression. His advocacy for mercy and 
refraining from vengeance was a notable divergence from the 
customary 'eye for an eye' principle of his era. **


The hesitation of Western scholars to employ Occam's 
Razor—favoring the simplest explanation—and acknowledge the 
possibility that Jesus' message might be a continuation of the 
peaceful philosophies that had thrived along the Silk Roads, 
potentially dating back hundreds of years to the eastern reaches 
of these trade networks, remains, as earlier mentioned, a blind spot.



Syria: The Western Melting Pot of Ascetic Practices

**The ethos of Ashoka, focusing on visibility and 
accessibility, is mirrored in the ascetic practices of early 
Syrian pillar saints of the 4th century. These saints, like St. 
Simeon Stylites, established their pillars as spiritual beacons, 
akin to spiritual lighthouses, prominently positioned at key 
caravan intersections to offer guidance. Despite their ascetic 
lifestyles, many of these hermits were not reclusive but actively 
provided spiritual counsel to seekers.**


The concept of pillar saints can be seen as an evolved 
interpretation of the stupa's symbolism in Buddhist tradition, 
where stupas are revered as embodiments of the saintly spirit. 
This reverence is not just metaphorical; in some traditions, 
notably in Tibet, there was a practice where young monks would 
voluntarily seclude themselves in a stupa for the remainder of 
their lives. This ritualistic confinement within the stupa, 
sustained by a small entrance and a stream for food and water, 
was a profound expression of devotion. It underscores the belief 
in the stupa as a living embodiment of spirituality, bridging 
the tangible and the ethereal, much like the pillar saints who, 
through their ascetic practices, sought to transcend the 
physical and connect more deeply with the divine.



Influences on Early Christian Monasticism in Syria

**

The establishment of monastic systems, indisputably pioneered by 
Buddhism under Emperor Ashoka, presents an intriguing parallel 
with the development of early Christian monasticism in regions 
like Syria and Egypt. Considering this historical backdrop, it 
seems unlikely that the organizational structure of early 
Christian monasteries emerged independently without any 
influence from their Buddhist counterparts. Both Buddhist and 
Syrian Christian monastic practices struck a balance between 
solitary spiritual discipline and active community involvement 
in education and service. Monks in both traditions had the 
option of either a reclusive life or a communal existence within 
the monastery, maintaining a constant connection with the 
broader society.**


Additionally, historian Will Durant’s reference to Buddhist 
gravestones in Alexandria, Egypt, dating from the inception of 
Christianity, suggests a Buddhist presence in
[
significant early Christian centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_influences_on_Christianity'). This further supports 
the possibility of Buddhist practices influencing the formation 
and structure of Christian monastic life in these areas.



The Rosary: A Thread of Devotion

**The tradition of using prayer beads dates back to the 
Buddhist cultural spheres prior to the Mauryan dynasty. This 
practice was later echoed by the early Christian desert fathers 
in the 3rd and 4th centuries, who used prayer ropes with knots 
for their devotions.
In the broader Christian tradition, these prayer aids became 
known as the rosary, from the Latin 'rosarium'. In the Sanskrit 
tradition, a similar string of prayer beads is called a 
'japa-mala', where 'japa' signifies the meditative chanting of 
holy mantras.

[Dr. Phil 
Christian Lindtner](https://www.jesusisbuddha.com/index.html), 
notes that the Sanskrit term 'japā', when translated 
independently of the mala context, signifies a rose, thus 
inspiring the term 'rosarium'.



**
THE GREEK INFLUENCE ON BUDDHISM & INDIA IN GENERAL

**In 326 BC, Alexander the Great's arrival in Northwestern 
India marked a significant cultural shift. His army of 150,000 
introduced a Hellenistic mindset, bringing diverse Greek 
professionals who infused new ideas and knowledge into the 
region. This influx, occurring during a period of social 
upheaval due to earlier Achaemenid Persian influences, made 
India particularly receptive to Greek cultural elements. As 
noted by historians Irfan Habib and Vivekanand Jha, Alexander's 
invasion and prior Achaemenid intrusions had already opened 
India to external influences, which Ashoka later expanded 
significantly. The long-term result was a robust network of 
communication, military, and trade, deeply ingrained through the 
Hellenistic satrap kings, ensuring a lasting interconnectedness 
among these realms, fostered by shared Hellenistic heritage and 
strong ties with Indian commerce.**


Greek Medicine

**Another example of Greek influence in Northwest India is the 
existence of a Greek traditional medicine in Punjab, known as 
Unani medicine. "Unani" or "Yavana" is the Indian term for an 
Ionian, or a Greek. Unani medicine coexists with India's own 
Ayurvedic herbal medicine and modern Western medicine.

** 
*Greek Unani medicine made by my Indian friend Anurag Sood's 
uncle, Joginder Paul, in Hoshiarpur, Punjab, is based on ancient 
Persian texts. The 'vitality medicine' that Yoginder prepared in 
2008 was exceedingly complex to produce, consisting of a variety 
of herbs and plants ranging from West Afghanistan to the Indian 
Himalayas. According to Yoginder, this medicine was created by 
Alexander's physicians as a tonic for his weary army. It took 
the uncle six months to make this medicine. He passed away 
shortly after as the last in a long line of descendants who had 
learned to make Unani medicine from father to son.*



Architechture and sculpturing

**Before Alexander’s arrival, large-scale stone construction 
in India was not commonly practiced, aside from earlier 
civilizations like the Indus Valley, which had used stone and 
brick. After Chandragupta Maurya's reign, Indians adopted the 
use of stone for larger constructions from Persian influences. 
However, the intricate art of sculpting in stone was learned 
from Greek craftsmen who came with Alexander. This marked a 
significant
[
shift in Indian architecture and sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture_in_the_Indian_subcontinent), leading to the 
creation of stone temples and statues. These advancements, 
integrating Persian architectural techniques and Greek artistic 
skills, signaled a new epoch in Indian construction and 
artistry, leaving a legacy of stone that bears witness to the 
synthesis of these cultural influences.**


The Greek Polis-Oasis 


**The Hellenistic influence on Bactria's urban centers, 
reflected in the Greek polis-oasis model, fostered a vibrant 
cultural life. Theatres became fixtures in Alexandrian and 
Seleucian cities, where Greek dramatic traditions mingled with 
local storytelling.



![](/images/teater1.jpg)



![](/images/teater2.jpg)

**
*Bactrian Greek theatre tickets in molded 
glass.

The First Ticket portrays an offering scene. It features a ram, 
followed closely by a man with an axe, both positioned on the 
medallion's rim. The man wears a primitive sheepskin skirt, 
indicating a ritualistic context. This scene parallels ancient 
Greek practices where blood sacrifices revitalized the dead, 
akin to a scene in "The Odyssey" where Odysseus seeks wisdom 
from the deceased seer Tiresias.



The Second Ticket: Commonly found on "cosmetic palettes" (whose 
original purpose is unclear), this scene depicts a woman 
revealing herself to a man or vice versa. It seems to be a 
variant of the "woman in the window" motif, reminiscent of the
[Jezebel story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezebel). 
This suggests a theme of seduction or revelation, prevalent in 
ancient storytelling and theatrical traditions.



These interpretations align these artifacts with known cultural 
and religious practices from the ancient world, illustrating a 
blend of mundane and spiritual themes in the art of the period. The style and imagery suggest a 
cultural blend, as theatrical performances were a significant 
part of Greek culture, and this tradition could have been merged 
with local Bactrian storytelling and religious narratives.*



This cultural blend extended to 
religious art, where 
Greek methods of sculpting in stone evolved into the use of 
stucco. This medium allowed for greater expression of 
individuality, a value cherished in both the Ptolemaic and 
Seleucid kingdoms. Unfortunately, many stucco artifacts, 
particularly in Afghanistan, have been lost to religious 
extremism, but their discovery points to a rich legacy of 
Hellenistic artistic expression in the region.



![](/images/munk.jpg)


*This stucco portrait of a Buddhist monk 
represents a fusion of Hellenistic and Buddhist artistic 
traditions. The asymmetry of the lips and the interplay between 
sensuality and introspection suggest a personalized expression 
of individuality. Departing from the stylized norms of later 
Buddhist art, the precision in facial features here captures a 
unique personality. The monk's closed eyes and the tranquil 
asymmetry of the face evoke a meditative state. Skilled in Greek 
realism, the artisans have rendered a piece that conveys the 
spiritual essence of Buddhist thought through a distinctly human 
portrayal. This sculpture serves as a profound example of the 
cultural and artistic interchanges between the Hellenistic and 
Buddhist worlds.*



The cultural and commercial compass of Alexander’s new 
city-states was, as already mentioned, linked like pearls in a 
necklace stretching from Northern India to the Mediterranean 
lands and Greece.



This chain of interconnected cities facilitated the 
Hellenization of not only the areas around them but also the 
cultures living along and within the caravan trails.



Through these cities, metaphorically seen as incubators of 
foreign culture, India was 'infected' by the Greek 'virus.' 
However, the influence also flowed in the opposite direction, as 
was evident in Alexander's own lifestyle, especially after 
conquering Persia. Even his most loyal, particularly the older, 
generals criticized him for increasingly adopting foreign 
customs, thereby distancing himself from his Macedonian roots. 
Alexander, like many conquerors before and after him, became 
enamored with the lands he conquered. The only one of his 
generals to take up this tradition and even evolve it was 
Seleucus Nicator.



As we will see in the following sections, the message of Ashokan 
Buddhism could spread so far west precisely because of the trade 
and cultural routes established by Alexandrian Hellenism. 
Simultaneously, Greek mathematics, art, culture, and 
particularly logical philosophy flowed eastward toward India, 
becoming crucial to the construction of Buddhism in the 
centuries before and after the Common Era. In this process, the 
Eastern and Western cultural currents reshaped each other's 
self-perceptions and expressions in an ongoing dialogue until 
the Hunnic invasions in the 5th century AD and later Islamic 
invasions.



BUDDHA GAINS A GREEK PERSONA

**Indeed, when considering the development of Ashoka-Buddhism, 
one must acknowledge the significant Hellenistic influences that 
flowed from the Seleucid and subsequent
[
Greco-Bactrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom) and
[
Indo-Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Greek_Kingdom) cultures. Caravanic communication, much like a 
two-lane road, allowed for the exchange of ideas and cultural 
practices in both directions. It was not Indians but rather the 
Greeks who fashioned the earliest statues of the Buddha. These 
figures were draped not in traditional Indian garb but in the
[Greek himation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himation), 
underscoring the profound Hellenistic impact on Buddhist 
iconography.**


The Greek influence on Buddhism is thus hidden in plain sight. 
It is subtly embedded within its very iconography. While 
scholars with a focus on national narratives may acknowledge the 
Hellenistic aesthetic of the Buddha's depictions, they often 
understate the depth of Greek philosophical impact that 
accompanies the folds of the himation.

The sartorial details of the 
Buddha statues are not merely artistic choices; they are 
vestiges of a profound intellectual exchange between Greek and 
Buddhist thought, manifesting in a visual form that has become 
emblematic of Buddhist art. The synthesis of Greek artistic 
techniques with Buddhist symbolism gave birth to a unique style 
of statuary known as 
[
Greco-Buddhist art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhist_art) 
and the later
[
Kushan-Gandharan art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture_in_the_Indian_subcontinent).



The creation of these statues marks a significant evolution in 
Buddhist art, representing a shift from aniconic 
representations, such as footprints or the Bodhi tree, to 
anthropomorphic depictions of the Buddha. This evolution was not 
just an artistic development but also a reflection of the 
growing exchange of ideas and religious practices along the 
trade routes connecting the East and West.



The Artistic Fusion of Hellenistic Influence and Buddhist 
Statuary

**The aesthetic characteristics of these Buddhist statues, 
with their undulating hair reminiscent of Greek deities and 
their tranquil, contemplative visages, bear the hallmarks of the 
Hellenistic sculptural tradition, tracing back to archaic period 
masterpieces like the statues of
[
Cleobis and Biton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleobis_and_Biton). This artistic exchange played a pivotal 
role in propagating Buddhism into areas steeped in Greek 
culture, thereby easing the faith's assimilation and acceptance 
across new territories.**


Thus, the creation of the first Buddha statues is a testament to 
the enduring legacy of the interactions between Ashoka's India 
and the Hellenistic kingdoms that arose from Alexander's 
conquests. The aesthetic and philosophical exchanges along these 
routes enriched both the Greek and Buddhist traditions, leading 
to lasting artistic legacies that continue to be admired to this 
day.



In essence, the familiar 
representation of the Buddha—with the serene expression and 
stylized drapery reminiscent of Greek sculpture—owes much to 
this intercultural dialogue. The Greek artisans, interacting 
with Buddhist concepts, interpreted the Buddha's image through 
their own artistic lens, giving rise to the depictions that have 
become widely recognized today. Thus, the Buddha's image as 
commonly known now is indeed significantly shaped by Greek 
artistic conventions. In fact, the Greek introduced to the East 
the idea of individuality.



In this way the Ashokan mission disseminated a unique synthesis 
of Buddhism, Hellenism, and Persian thought throughout the 
empire and beyond. Boundaries between faith, art and ordinary 
life became fluid, creating a rich, multi-cultural tapestry 
along established trade routes.

****
The Great Wheel Expansion of the Greek Buddha

**As Buddhism began to wane in India, its land of origin, it 
found new vigor and sanctuary in adjacent regions such as Sri 
Lanka, Tibet, China, Burma (Myanmar, and Thailand, where it 
took root and flourished.**
Amidst the fervent spread of missionary work, Ashokan 
Buddhism—already established in various regions—took on a 
renewed focus centered upon the figure of the Buddha. In this 
era, Buddhism, particularly the 
[Mahayana or 
'Great Vehicle' tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana), evolved into a diverse practice 
that harmonized the popular, devotional worship of the Buddha 
with sophisticated, philosophical thought. Mahayana Buddhism, in 
particular, revered the Buddha as a divine being in human guise, 
epitomizing him as an embodiment of inner beauty and grace, akin 
to the aesthetic ideals of the Greek sculptural heritage. This 
portrayal echoed the transformation of the 
Hellenistic-Egyptian-Persian archetype of the divine warrior, 
exemplified by Alexander, into the image of the tranquil ascetic 
Buddha known today. This metamorphosis paralleled the profound 
journey of Ashoka himself, who underwent a transformation from a 
fierce warrior king to a devout renunciate, reflecting a 
spiritual evolution both personal and cultural.



The anthropomorphic conception of divinity from Alexander's 
Hellenism was, in a sense, a regression compared to the more 
abstract religious notion of nirvana originally espoused by the 
Brahmins and Buddha, which did not emphasize the body as a 
religious message in itself. However, the anthropomorphization 
of Buddha into the beautiful form of Greek statues helped 
Mahayana Buddhism become a popular religion.



The emergence of the "Wheel of Dharma" Buddhism, with its 
altruistic worldview was, with its logic and down-to-earth 
approach, most probably a result of a synthesis of Seleucid and 
later Bactrian-Greek rationality and Indian spirituality. 




Greek Buddhism versus Hinduism

**Many years ago, when I visited the predominantly Buddhist 
rock-cut caves of Ajanta and Ellora (200 BCE to 600 CE) in 
India, the contrast between the Buddhist and Hindu caves was 
striking. Although the Buddhist caves displayed more Apollonian 
restraint compared to the Dionysian diversity of gods in the 
Hindu caves, this impression turned on its head upon entering 
the inner sanctum. Inside the Buddhist caves, at the holiest 
core, stood a statue of the Greek Buddha as an Alexander in 
divinized human form. In contrast, the Hindu temples, which 
began like a visit to Disneyland, culminated in an utterly empty 
space in the inner sanctuum.**


The notion of god in human form, where the human figure itself 
could represent the divine logos, was widely accepted within the 
pan-Hellenistic cultural sphere. However, this anthropomorphic 
concept was unfamiliar in India before Alexander's invasion. The 
Brahmins, 
[
according to historical accounts](https://www.jstor.org/stable/631646#:~:text=URL: https://www), vigorously debated this 
subject with Alexander and his philosophers. The Brahmins' 
abstract conception of god as the transcendent principle of 
Brahman was incompatible with the Greek ideal of a beautiful 
soul in a beautiful body.



Clan-solidarity versus Universal brotherhood

**Larger states, in their consolidation phase, typically 
prioritize peaceful coexistence among diverse peoples and 
cultures. Such states differ from smaller clan-based states in 
that they foster a sense of brotherhood among people from 
different backgrounds without relying heavily on military 
dominance.**


While pre-Buddhist religions, like Judaism, also teach goodness 
and love, it's the unconditional, pan-humanistic love in 
Buddhism and to some extent also Christianity that stands out. 
It extends beyond clan consciousness, aiming to connect diverse 
people through enlightened humanity.



One essential observation to note is the expansive cultural 
reach of larger empires, extending well beyond their territorial 
borders. These dominant civilizations are repositories of highly 
sophisticated cultural and social knowledge, which is a critical 
factor enabling them to succeed in wars and conquests. Take, for 
example, Alexander the Great's military campaigns, particularly 
in Persia. His advanced military organization and technology 
acted akin to a viral pandemic, setting off a Darwinian 
competition between cultures in a struggle for survival of the 
fittest. Following the initial phase of warfare, a period of 
peaceful adaptation often ensues within the newly conquered 
territories. This process bears a striking resemblance to 
evolutionary dynamics, where humans, over time, have learned to 
coexist with and even benefit from the presence of bacteria and 
viruses. The peaceful adaptation period allows for the 
integration and assimilation of cultural, technological, and 
social elements from the conquering empire, much like how humans 
have developed symbiotic relationships with microorganisms.



In this way, the cultural and technological "viruses" that 
empires spread as a general rule leads to periods of adaptation 
and even mutual benefit. The spread of culture, then, is not 
merely an act of imposition but also one of complex, often 
reciprocal, exchange and adaptation, even to the point where the 
conquered civilization exerts cultural influence over its 
conqueror.



A latin quote from Horace's "Epistulae II. i. 156" beautifully 
encapsulates this phenomenon. In this case, Greece, after being 
conquered, managed to "capture" Rome by infusing it with its 
art, culture, and wisdom.



*"Graecia capta ferum victorem 
cepit et artes intulit agresti Latio."

*(Conquered Greece 
conquered her savage conqueror

and brought the arts into rustic Latium.)




Jesus in the East

**As we reflect on the cultural exchanges of antiquity, it is 
evident that Christianity, like Buddhism, traversed great 
distances. This stucco head from Bactria may indeed represent an 
Eastern depiction of Jesus, resembling a Greek philosopher. The 
detailed rendering of a crown of thorns, coupled with the visage 
marked by affliction, strongly suggests a Hellenistic 
interpretation of the Christian savior. Such an artifact could 
signify the mutual influence of Eastern and Western spiritual 
traditions, perhaps even influencing the development of Mahayana 
Buddhism's Great Wheel.



![](/images/Jesus1.jpg)

**
*This stucco head from Bactria, interpreted as 
a birded representation of Jesus Christ, reflects a synthesis of Greek 
and Christian iconography. The crown, resembling a wreath, and 
the expressive face marked by lines of suffering, align with 
traditional portrayals of Jesus in Christian art, particularly 
emphasizing his passion and crucifixion. The execution of the 
sculpture, with its detailed beard and contemplative gaze, 
echoes the style of Greek philosopher portraits, suggesting an 
intent to depict Jesus within this philosophical tradition. This 
artifact underscores the spread of Christianity into the East, 
and illustrates the cultural dialogues between Hellenistic art 
and early Christian symbolism. The use of stucco for 
iconographic purposes in the Bactrian region likely peaked 
during the early centuries AD, influenced by Hellenistic 
traditions. Given that this artistic medium and the portrayal of 
religious figures in such a manner were not common beyond the 
4rd century AD, this artifact could be among the initial 
attempts to visually represent Jesus, merging Hellenistic 
artistic styles with the emergent iconography of Christianity as 
it spread eastward. The emphasis on the human aspect of Jesus in 
the stucco head might suggest an influence from early
[Dyophysite 
Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyophysitism), which asserts the dual nature of Christ as 
both fully divine and fully human. This theological stance was a 
central aspect of the Chalcedonian Creed established in the 5th 
century. The representation of Jesus with a strong human 
likeness, as seen in the stucco head, aligns with Dyophysite 
thought, emphasizing that while Jesus was divine, his human 
experiences, emotions, and sufferings were also very real. This 
could reflect the cultural and theological exchanges between 
East and West, where Eastern Christianity, particularly in 
regions like Syria, had significant interactions with 
Hellenistic cultures that might have influenced religious art 
and iconography.

*This image of the Bactrian stucco head, 
captured from a different angle, clearly reveals that the head 
ornament comprises thorns, not flowers. This detail 
significantly alters the interpretation of the sculpture, 
aligning it more closely with traditional Christian depictions 
of Jesus Christ, particularly referencing the crown of thorns 
associated with his crucifixion.*



According to professor Diamaid Mc 
Culloch in 
*A History of Christianity, were * it not for the Islamic 
invasions, the center of Christianity would not be Rome and/or 
Constantinoble, but much farther Eastwards like Baghdad. 
Christianity
was like Buddhism on a mission 
and it went as far as China.




BUDDHA AND JESUS: BILBOARDS FOR 
WANDERING NARRATIVES

**In summary the Silk Roads transcended their role as mere 
conduits of commerce, acting as vital conduits for cultural 
exchange. These routes allowed for the intermingling and 
transformation of wisdom, narratives, and collective experiences 
among civilizations. As illustrated earlier, the Buddhist Jataka 
tales, initially spread through oral traditions, evolved and 
integrated into global literary treasures such as the Persian "*One 
Thousand and One Nights,*" eventually permeating European 
culture. This narrative exchange, akin to the movement of 
currency, signifies the profound interconnectedness fostered by 
the Silk Roads, blending the material with the intellectual and 
spiritual.**


** 

**
Famous persons are both 
symbolic repositories and historical figures****

**Examining the New Testament’s depiction of Jesus, we encounter 
two distinct portrayals: one is a more confrontational figure, 
while the other embodies non-violence and forgiveness. The 
grafting of narratives onto a local figure doesn't always 
seamlessly align with the individual's character, suggesting a 
historical basis for Jesus. The discrepancies in these stories 
indicate the layers of narrative added over time, pointing to 
Jesus as a tangible historical figure.**


States, religious bodies and scholarly traditions mirror oral 
storytelling, perpetuating wisdom by weaving widespread tales, 
myths, and motifs.



Jesus, historically and presently, has been molded by church 
authorities, blending external influences with local narratives. 
This process incorporates 'good'—or pedagogically potent—stories 
from various sources.



The constructed nature of Jesus and Buddha does not diminish 
their reality; social construction is what defines reality.



Jesus and Buddha serve as focal points for collective wisdom, 
akin to billboards for wandering narratives, capturing 
historical, political, and cultural insights. Thus, they are 
both symbolic repositories and historical figures.

*

*In the extensive cultural fusion between East and West, it's 
reductive to view Christianity simply as a copy of Buddhism. 
German scholar
[
Burkhard Scherer](https://www.jesusisbuddha.com/PDF/DR%20BURKHARD%20SCHERER.pdf) acknowledges the presence of "much Buddhist 
stuff" in the Gospel, but clarifies that it's not the sole or 
even primary source for the New Testament.



Christianity stands as a significant Western creation of 
civilizational self-control, where Buddhism is not the only 
influence. Yet, examining abstract social behaviors, we see the 
East's early development of religious self-control, predating 
Western equivalents. This influence transcends language, with 
pre-linguistic, embodied interactions impacting cross-cultural 
exchanges. The concepts of goodness and forgiveness, rooted in 
embodied practices, originated in the East, specifically on the 
Gangetic plains, long before they found expression in the Jewish-Roman 
context that birthed Christianity.

* *

Every culture is 
essentially a creative blend of influences from others, a 
reality that applies to all religions and social phenomena. 
However, interpreting these cultural exchanges purely through 
the lens of power dynamics, as often done by scholars influenced 
by Foucault's postmodernist ideas, suggests a problematic 
simplification in academic thought. In this context, postmodern 
'wokism' can be likened to a form of religious belief, similar 
to how[ 
scholars with strong religious convictions might study religion.](#ACADEMIC_EUROCENTRISM_IN_RELIGIOUS_STUDIES_) 
This approach tends to ignore the complex nature of cultural 
interactions, which involve much more than power and religious 
biases. They also include shared technology, cultural knowledge, 
mutual understanding, and cooperative development.



We are now ready for the next chapter, 


[Civilization and Consciousness

of this exploration: consciousness.



Moving forward, we will embark on 


[Civilization and 
Consciousness Part II](/civilization/civilization-and-consciousness-ii) 
pivoting back to our core inquiry: the enigmatic nature of 
consciousness. This next chapter will broaden our perspective, 
offering a deeper understanding of consciousness within the 
tapestry of civilization.






EPILOGUE OF A DREAM - *
The Indo-Greek Genesis of Nothing******

***The decimal system, often misattributed as Arabic, was 
in fact a seminal Indian invention, with the concept of zero 
representing a significant intellectual leap. The Hindi term for 
zero, "shunya," denoting emptiness, echoes the profound 
philosophical traditions of India where the notion of void is 
pivotal.**


It’s noteworthy that the Hindi word for zero, "shunya," is a 
religious term for emptiness, likely influenced by the Indian 
religious philosophy where voidness plays a crucial role across 
Hindu Brahmanism, Jainism, and Buddhism. The concept of zero, or 
nirvana in Buddhism, can be seen as an extension of this 
mathematical void.



In Western thought, arising from ancient Greece's denial of 
zero, consciousness is often misconstrued as something tangible. 
This search for the concrete overshadows the appreciation of 
'nothingness.' In Indian culture, being called a 'zero' could be 
a compliment, reflecting a state of supreme emptiness as 
extolled by sages like Ramana Maharshi, known as the Great 
Emptiness.



The philosophers accompanying Alexander the Great to India 
encountered Indian sages adept in philosophical discourse, yet 
the Western acknowledgment of foreign cultural contributions to 
our own has been limited.



Zero first graphically appeared on a temple in Gwalior, India, 
in 876 AD.

The philosophical 
concept of emptiness, pivotal to Eastern thought, likely evolved 
through East-West dialogues during the Hellenistic period. It is 
plausible that Indian Buddhist monks, educated in Greek thought, 
formulated the idea of zero. The intellectual exchange catalyzed 
by King Menander's adoption of Buddhism may have also introduced 
these monks to Greek dialectics. This cross-pollination of ideas 
could explain the logical and almost secular nature of Buddhism 
as perceived in the West. The legacy of these dialogues 
persists, notably in the
[debate 
practices of Tibetan monastic traditions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8OSBpm81f8).



This tradition of debate traces back to a protracted ideological 
struggle where Buddhism faced resistance in India. During the 
early centuries AD, as society saw a reassertion of Brahmanical 
order, Buddhists engaged in intense public debates with Hindus. 
As [Will 
Durant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Durant) notes, these debates were so fervent that the loser 
sometimes faced mortal consequences. Buddhists employed 
Greek-influenced logic to advocate for anatman, the 
non-existence of a permanent soul, while Advaita Vedanta Hindus 
argued for the existence of an eternal essence, Atman/Brahman.



The notion that existence is "shunya" or emptiness, became a 
central tenet of Buddhist philosophy with Nagarjuna, presenting 
a stark contrast to Brahmanic traditions that emphasized a more 
tangible ultimate reality. This philosophical divergence likely 
played a role in the conceptual development of the mathematical 
zero in India, a hypothesis that aligns with Occam's Razor—the 
principle that the simplest explanation is often 
correct—suggesting that zero emerged from these dynamic cultural 
and philosophical exchanges.



The irony indeed is profound. The very foundations of Western 
science and technology, which espouse a positivistic worldview, 
owe a significant debt to the Indian concept of zero—a notion 
conceived within a deeply religious context.

An Intriguing but Isolated Figure: 
Dr. Phil Christian 
Lindtner**


[www.Jesusisbuddha.com](http://www.Jesusisbuddha.com) 
- curated by Dr. Phil Christian Lindtner

Dr. Christian Lindtner is a figure 
who has stirred considerable controversy and, as a result, finds 
himself on the periphery of mainstream academic discourse. His 
theories, while unique, have been met with skepticism and are 
often regarded as overly simplistic and speculative within 
mainstream academic discourse.
[
Burkhard Scherer](https://www.jesusisbuddha.com/PDF/DR%20BURKHARD%20SCHERER.pdf) notes: *CL here very dangerously deviates 
from sound scholarship into the dungeons of half-insane 
amateurism.***


Furthermore, Lindtner, like many specialists, exhibit a certain 
obliviousness to topics beyond his immediate expertise. For 
instance, his assertion that Jesus was a non-historical figure, 
used to underpin his theory that the New Testament is 
essentially a reiteration of Buddhist scriptures, can be 
challenged. The evolution and adaptation of the Jataka Tales 
demonstrate the flaw in such a provocative claim. Stories and 
myths evolve and transform as they traverse cultures. Upon 
reaching new lands, they often become personalized, centering 
around a local figure, thereby acquiring a unique, localized 
expression. Thus, Christianity is not merely a facsimile of 
Buddhism; rather, it has been profoundly influenced by Buddhist 
teachings and adapted them within its own spiritual and cultural 
framework.
