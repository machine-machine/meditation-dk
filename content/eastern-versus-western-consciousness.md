Consciousness in the East and the West

CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE 
EAST AND THE WEST **




*East is East, and West is West, **
and [never the twain 
shall meet](Meditation_Frigorelse_af_jeg.htm#Hvad_er_virkeligt)**.*

R. Kipling




Thanks to the scientific 
breakthroughs in the West we were able to bring more food to the 
table than other cultures. However, there was a trade off. We 
became spiritually drowsy.



The West's philosophic and scientific elite, as 
seen through Eastern eyes, has confused the content of 
consciousness with consciousness itself.
This becomes evident in Descartes' famous statement:



*Cogito, ergo sum - I think, therefore I am.

*


Here, consciousness is made identical to the thinking mind.
In contrast, the wise sages of the East, particularly those from 
India, would assert:



*Non cogito, ergo sum - I do not think, therefore I am.*





![](/images/tanker.jpg)




The Indian sage Sri Ramana 
Maharshi would smile indulgently at Descartes and pose the 
question:




What is it that observes the thoughts?

What is it that remains when the stream of thoughts quiets down?




In the captivating world of Indian 
philosophy, the thinking 'I' is seen as nothing more than a veil 
shrouding our true nature - Consciousness itself. The renowned 
Indian mystic, Sri Aurobindo, beautifully expressed this idea:




*True knowledge is not attained by thinking. It is what you 
are.*




Decartes's statement is based on introspection. However, 
it stops with the observation of the thinking mind. A pointer from 
the chain-smoking Indian shopkeeper,
[
Nisargadatta Maharaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisargadatta_Maharaj) would have helped Decartes go a little 
further in his quest:



Watch your thoughts and watch yourself watching 
the thoughts.




Interestingly, Descartes's famous statement still holds true 
when viewed from the perspective of the ego.



During a soul-searching journey into the hidden realms of Indian 
wisdom, I engaged in a thought-provoking discussion with my 
friend and mentor, [Bhaharadwaj.](meditator_sag_%20bharadwaj.htm) With a knowing smile, he 
suggested a more profound question to ponder:




*What is it that witnesses the thoughts? 


What remains when the 
mind is still and the senses are silenced?*




With a twinkle in his eye, my ever-joyful spiritual mentor 
brought up James Joyce's famous book, 
["*Ulysses*"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)). 
Bhaharadwaj had been a lecturer in philosophy and English 
literature at the University of Lahore before the partition in 
1947. In his youth, he was captivated by this literary 
masterpiece.



Years later, his Consciousness underwent a sudden and profound 
transformation, expanding in both intensity and quality. It was 
then that he saw the irony in the title of Joyce's iconic work. 
He explained with a smile, "*There is no stream of Consciousness. 
There is only ego-fuss in Consciousness. Consciousness is the 
primordial essence, existing beyond the mind's movements. The 
title of the book should have been rephrased to:*




*Stream of Thoughts IN 
Consciousness.*

*Bhaharadwaj IN consciousness*




At the time the picture was taken, 
he was 94 years old. Bhaharadwaj was one of the most loving and 
joyful people I have ever met, and on top of that, he was 
incredibly intelligent. He knew western philosophy and 
litterature better than me, not to mention Indian philosophy.



India, a land of wonders, mysteries, and paradoxes, captured my 
heart and soul as I spent years there on a quest for 
self-discovery.



What did India have in store for me?



In essence, nothing... But I wasn't disappointed.

As Meister Eckhart once said, *If a man who seeks nothing finds 
nothing, what has he to complain? After all, he has found what 
he sought.*



Indeed, I found precisely what I sought, and Bhaharadwaj was not 
the only 'nothing' that guided me towards understanding 
something profound.

In the eyes of this enchanting

and something. She was a friend of Bhaharadwaj, and in the photo 
on the right, I knew her as 
[Sita](female_meditation_saint.htm).



Indians, until recently, possessed a remarkable ability to 
transition between deep depersonalization and full human 
engagement. Their unique form of depersonalization, unlike the 
detached expressions often seen in Western public spaces, delved 
much deeper, as evidenced by the gaze in the left image above. 
At any given moment, they could switch into a zero-mode. Sadly, 
this fascinating ability has largely vanished in modern India, 
with the growing middle class losing this conscious zero-mode to 
the hypnotic pull of their smartphones and fancy clad TV- and 
social media gurus.


The Indian Witness of 
Consciousness ... & Meister Eckhart

**The Western traditions of science and philosophy have largely 
overlooked the wealth of ancient Indian mystical traditions.**


In ancient Indian philosophy, it is posited that Consciousness, 
not material objects, forms the foundation of everything else. 
They view this Consciousness as 
separate from the world of objects and senses, taking the form 
of a detached witness of experience.




*Two birds, inseparable 
companions, perch on the same tree; one eats the fruit, the 
other looks on. The first bird is our individual self-feeding on 
the pleasures and pains of his deeds; The other is the universal 
self, silently witnessing all. -* Mandukya Upanishad 3.1.1




However, hidden keys for understanding 
Consciousness can also be found in Western mysticism. The same 
understanding of separation is present in Meister Eckhart's 
works:




... there are 
in everyone two men: one, the outward man, is his objective 
nature; the man is served by the five senses, albeit he is 
energized by the power of the soul. The other, the inner man, is 
man's subjective nature... Take an illustration. The door goes 
to and fro upon its hinges. Now the projecting door I liken to 
the outward man and the hinge I liken to the inner man. As it 
shuts and opens, the door swings to and fro while the hinge 
remains unmoved in the same place without undergoing any change.




To be unmoved is to be free from 
experience, as experience is what moves you. Consciousness makes 
experience possible in our brains, but it is, in itself, like 
the hinge or a mirror detached from experience.




So how can we come closer to the phenomenon of consciousness? 
Precisely because consciousness is the primordial foundation of 
everything, including itself, there can never be a satisfying 
scientific, positivist-based explanation for the phenomenon of 
consciousness.



That, however, does not mean that we should not try.



My favorite spiritual inspirator, 
[Papaji,](papaji_and_meditation.htm) once said:




My whole life, 
I have wanted to kiss her, but I have never seen Her.




He was speaking about 
consciousness and his passionate relationship with 'it'.






The Mirror and the Reflected**




*As images are seen in a mirror, 
so the universe**
is an image in the mirror of Consciousness.

*Tripura Rahasya XL verses 53-54






![](/images/Mirrorpot.jpg)




Let us again return to western 
understanding of consciousness 
reached through observations 
of phenomena. Figuratively speaking, it is like 
trying to understand a mirror based on a description of the 
content reflected in the mirror. In the West, we have 
fundamentally not discovered the mirror itself but have focused 
on examining the reflected object.



The Indian perspective on existence is far 
wiser: You are NOT what is being observed, neither thoughts nor 
external objects. You are much closer to the observer itself. 
You are NOT an experience, either a thought or an emotion.

How did the Indians discover this deeper mirror like layer of 
consciousness. They discovered the mirror discover the mirror in 
detachment from the world.



Spiritual Indian Aid

**Let's face it. It doesn't take much experience in meditation 
to realize that since ancient times, Indians have been far more advanced in 
exploring consciousness. Only rare
[pre-plague](#The_Blessings_of_the_Black_Death_) pearls from the 
West like Meister Eckhart can be counted along in this treasure 
trove. We need spiritual Indian aid when it comes to discovering 
deeper aspects of the enigmatic phenomenon of consciousness. **



HOW THE INDIANS LOST THE WORLD TO GAIN NOTHING

**However, the Indian discovery of consciousness came with a 
huge price. The Indian survival strategy, not changing the surroundings, but changing oneself, 
resulted in a reenforcement of a vicious circle of lack of responsability in 
external affairs both on an individual and collective level. **


During my stays in India in the 1990s, I gained insight 
into an old polarity between body and spirit that, in the Indian 
time machine, had survived in small isolated pockets up until 
today. Here, far from the tourist routes, I encountered remnants 
of a spiritual culture that was likely thousands of years old.



I had the opportunity to meet people whose lives were 
radically different from anything we see on television or the 
internet. In a way, it was like meeting aliens from outer space. 
Retrieving completely unknown software from these people for my 
own construction of reality and consciousness became a passion 
for several years.




The Eastern 'Liberation' Project

**For the poor farmer and his family, it is inspiring to see 
how the pain of what one does not have can be transformed by how 
one accepts destiny. That is why it is primarily the poorest people who 
give alms to India’s wandering monks, the sadhus. The ascetics remind 
the poor of how dignified life can be, even without clothes on 
their backs.**


In fact, I must admit that my respect for India’s poor is 
immense.

Nowhere else in the world have I encountered such a dignified 
culture of poverty.

I know this is a dangerous viewpoint I am expressing here. 
India’s extremely poor underclass is, in a way, happier than the 
often self-satisfied nouveau-riche Indian middle class, even 
happier than us in the West. (This mostly applies to the rural 
poor, not the urban poor.) Spiritually, they are, in a sense, 
superior to us. They have looked inward in renunciation and 
thereby overcome the animal instincts and emotions triggered by 
hunger, misery, and the worst forms of social and caste 
oppression.



Nowhere is the idea that life is an illusion more pronounced 
than in the Indian spiritual traditions' relationship with the 
body. Where we in secular Western society call the spirit an 
illusion because it cannot be measured or weighed, India calls 
the physical world an illusion. A widespread meditation 
technique is to endlessly repeat: I am not the body.



In the Indian perspective, the body with all its desires and cravings must 
be negated for the soul to become free. We find traces of the same thought 
in the West, particularly in the worldview of the Church Father Augustine of 
Hippo. But the Indians have always been far more radical when it comes to 
denying the life of the body.



Even in modern India, one can see this illusive survival strategy reflected 
in the phlegmatic Hindu face you encounter again and again on your journey 
through the masses. This face seems wordlessly to say: when the next 
unexpected slap hits, it doesn’t matter much... I’m not really present 
anyway, because why would I be here in this illusory world?



Depersonalization as a survival strategy****

**The traditional Indian defaitist zero-mode can still be 
glimpsed in the faces and postures of the less fortunate. 
Even in modern India, in spite of 
the huge progress made by the middle class since the 80'ties, 
one can observe this ancient illusive survival strategy 
reflected in the phlegmatic Hindu face, a fractal-like presence 
encountered repeatedly while navigating through the masses of 
poor people. This face seems to wordlessly convey: When the next 
unexpected blow comes, it won't matter much... I am not truly 
present, for why should I give my best to this illusory world?**


Just 
before the COVID pandemic, I was walking through the bustling 
Main Bazaar in New Delhi and witnessed a scene all too familiar 
from my years in India. An impatient, overweight middle-class 
man, stuck in traffic on a cycle rickshaw, began berating and 
striking the rickshaw driver. With no means of fighting back, 
the driver withdrew into depersonalization, becoming a lifeless 
puppet, enduring the blows without even raising his hands in 
defense. In times past in Europe, one might have said, *"He bears 
his cross."* But in reality, he wasn't suffering; he had simply 
vanished from the stage of life, retreating into his own 
timeless inner sanctuary. It was India's low caste people, the 
Dalits, who taught me a new truth about meditation: Introversio 
had during millenias become the unfortunate man's survival 
strategy, an escape into conscious nothingness, *shoonyo*, 
detached from the body.



In this context, the rickshaw drivers residing in plastic tents 
with their families along the Yamuna River agree with Elon Musk. 
We exist in a simulation. Many of these Dalit individuals often 
have expressionless faces, yet unexpectedly, some radiate with a 
mysterious smile and a peculiar sparkle in their eyes. This is 
observed even as they navigate their rudimentarily built 
rickshaws through the city's accumulated plastic refuse.



This scenario presents a world that seemingly does not require 
order or cleaning. After all, if our existence is merely an 
illusion or a simulation, the necessity for such upkeep might be 
questioned.




Throughout India, from Kanyakumari in the South to the Ganges 
River in the Himalayas, folk tales, poems, and philosophical 
writings are found that all share a common theme: the 
impermanence and transience of life. The moral is: Do not become 
attached to your wife, your children, your house, or broadly 
speaking, to your life, because before you know it, it will all 
be over. Let go of life before it lets go of you. Life is 
fleeting like a dewdrop in the morning.



The argument in these teachings about the illusory nature of the 
world is that anything that changes is not real. Only that which 
is unchangeable is real. Based on this reasoning, it's clear 
that no phenomena in time and space can be real.



In contrast, the self's all-pervading perspective of 
consciousness is portrayed in its timelessness and immutability 
as the only reality.




What remains is a world that you don’t really need to clean up—why would you 
bother?




In all its absence of presence, in the form of freshly painted house 
facades, well-paved roads, and electricity without outages, India has 
actually found a charming solution. It’s called peace—stoic peace and 
acceptance of any situation. It has sprung from the idea of illusion, 
combined with the belief in fate that makes the individual 'karmically' 
responsible for every detail and event in life. The following picture I took 
while stuck in a traffic jam in New Delhi. Notice the dignified peace the 
seemingly random composition of people in the picture radiates.

*Nowhere is timelessness more apparent than in a traffic jam in 
New Delhi.

Chewing Gum and Absence****
On my way to India in 1992, I experienced a unique moment aboard 
an Air India flight where the bathroom door was precariously 
hanging on one hinge. Settling back into my seat, my gaze 
nervously shifted to the jet engine on the wing. Fortunately, 
both the engine and wing were securely in place. I whimsically 
wondered if Air India's mechanics had borrowed a bolt from the 
toilet door to keep the engine attached. India is full of 
impromptu, here-and-now solutions. I call them "chewing gum 
solutions," named after an incident where I discovered 
electrical wires under my hotel TV cabinet 'fixed' with a large 
blob of chewing gum. Holding this blob in my hands and standing 
barefoot on the marble floor, I was jolted like a lightbulb, 
sparking one of my most significant spiritual experiences.



At the five-star hotel Clarks in Varanasi, the handle for hot 
water broke off in my frantic attempt to adjust it while 
standing under the shower. In another five-star hotel, scalding 
hot water came out of both taps in the bathtub. It wasn't the 
first time that door handles, light switches, and faucets came 
off in my hand in this wonderfully fantastical land full of 
dreams and illusions.



Once, on a motorcycle trip in South India, a tailor sewed 
buttons onto my new Indian shirt, which, after just a month of 
wear, was ready for repair. As he worked, the tailor sang songs 
honoring his God, pointing towards the eye of the needle leading 
to heaven. When I got the shirt back, I discovered the new 
buttons were sewn on the wrong side!



A tailor! That's where the fun stops ... or begins.



All these wonderful craft performances were executed by the same 
illusive Indian who doesn't quite see the point in being present 
in this world. This perspective stems partly because the world 
is seen as an illusion and partly due to the disdain he faces 
for engaging in manual labor. Naturally, this also affects his 
ability to take responsibility for the quality of his 
craftsmanship.



If one views the world as 
[Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)), it becomes Maya.



In its absence of presence, marked by freshly painted house 
facades, well-paved roads, and uninterrupted power supply, India 
has actually found a charming solution. It's called serenity - 
stoic calm and acceptance of every situation. This attitude 
springs from the idea of illusion combined with the belief in 
fate, which makes each individual 'karmically' responsible for 
all details and events in their life.



Vishnu - The Upholder of Universal Balance

**In 1989, I witnessed an astonishing Vishnu temple ritual in 
Karnataka in South 
India. A ton-heavy statue of the god Vishnu is carried around on 
two long, arm-thick poles. Accompanying him on the cart are two 
smaller statues representing Vishnu's consorts.**


Ten sweating and groaning men struggle to maintain their footing 
under the weight of the stone deity. Vishnu, Lakshmi, and 
Mahadevi are splendidly dressed dolls with masks made of several 
kilos of pure gold. They wear heavy gold crowns on their heads. 
Leading the entire procession is a uniformed constable with a 
drawn baton, his serious face and raised truncheon guarding the 
precious god amidst an ecstatic crowd.



The ten bearers and their divine burden now stagger around the 
ritual and universe's center, a large stone pillar representing 
the procreative phallus of the god Shiva.



Electric wires from numerous colored lamps dangle from the 
ceiling in the huge ancient stone temple. As the procession passes beneath them, the gold crowns 
on the deities are nearly knocked off, and each time, the ten 
bearers must strain to bow deeply to avoid them. Occasionally, 
the gods are close to toppling.

A ten man orchestra of drums and
[shehnais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehnai), dramatically 
accompanies each close encounter with the wires, almost as if 
the Indians find amusement in the ordeal.



It's somewhat ironic to think that it's precisely Vishnu's duty 
to ensure the balance of the universe is maintained, yet here he 
perilously sways in his own temple.
The low-hanging wires are accepted by the worshippers as divine 
obstacles, akin to sacred Indian cows on the road.



No one, except me, seems to consider the simple solution of 
raising the wires slightly higher.





![](/images/ledningerdelhi.jpg)


*I don't have a photo of the temple scene in 
Karnataka.

However, these tangled wires in Main Bazar in

New Delhi can serve as an illustration.*




When the Tree Falls, it Falls 
in its own Space

**When I lived in Lucknow in 1994, some locals cut down a tree 
that ended up falling onto the road outside the house I was 
renting. It lay there for months, causing traffic jams during 
rush hour and several minor traffic accidents, especially after 
dark. Why didn't anyone move the tree to the side?**


Why didn't I remove the tree myself? It would have taken just 10 
minutes of work. However, by then, I had become part of the 
phlegmatic calm that flows with or around what is, without 
changing it.




This context lends meaning to the Indian invention 
of meditation. Unable to overcome external challenges, Indians 
would instead sit down, adapt, and/or change themselves. The 
image below illustrates how this mental strategy has permeated 
India, even influencing Indian road construction:






![](/images/Indienvej.jpg)


*Only in India can one find this type of road marking. *





The Indian escapes into himself to depersonalize himself into 
nothing. When you have deconstructed yourself into a pure zero, 
external obstacles or disasters do not matter. 
In the East, the searchlight was thus directed inward. Even 
today in India, this difference is clearly observable. Every 
time an obstacle arises, the Indian does not remove it. He 
adapts. One can observe this zero culture in the faces of the 
eternally destitute rickshaw man in the streets of New Delhi. He 
is not really present in his facial features, for if he were, 
his life would be unbearable.




In India the denial of the reality the world has 
taken many forms. In 1995 I met a remarkable individual, named 
[Capt. Lal Chand.](old_meditation_master.htm)



![](/images/Lalchand9.jpg)


Captain Lal Chand, a World War II veteran in the 
British army, displayed exceptional bravery against the Germans and was awarded 
a medal for his courage. Yet, he revealed to me that he retains no memory of 
these wartime experiences, having learned about them from others. His 
recollections are instead dominated by profound blissful states experienced 
during deep meditation. These spontaneous spiritual ruptures of ecstasy began 
for Captain Lal Chand following his initial meeting with Baba Faqir. While 
physically present on the battlefield, like a sleepwalker, his soul ascended 
beyond time and space. His
[Surat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat_Shabd_Yoga), or ultimate 
soul, later reintegrated with his body, reconnecting him to the worldly 
dimensions. This extraordinary story illustrates the profound disconnect that 
can occur between body and soul.



Another example of a profound Indian relation between body and soul can be 
observed in the photo below; A young ascetic keeps his arm up in the air 
day and night. After some years it will fall 
off due to the lack of blood flow. What the young man demonstrates by such an 
act is a synthesis of extreme body control and denial of the same.




![](/images/sadhuarm.jpg)


*Young sadhu from Rihiksh holding up his arm day and night*





Diogenes in the Cowshed

**In India, the illusory reality is symbolically represented by the 
goddess Maya. She spins her web of dreams over humanity.**


In Hoshiarpur, I also visited a hermit who had swapped his Himalayan cave 
for a concrete cowshed in the middle of the city of Hoshiarpur. Here, the 
hermit now sat with a blissful smile, his eyes closed in the unhealthy air 
of fresh concrete and cow dung in a stall on some straw alongside cows and 
buffaloes. These were conditions that no self-respecting Danish farm cow 
would have accepted.



I thought of Alexander’s meeting with Diogenes in the barrel—not in the 
sense that my life is otherwise comparable to Alexander's, but because of 
the dignity the hermit radiated sitting in his stall.



*“Move aside!”* Diogenes said to Alexander... “For I have forsaken more than 
you have conquered.”



I asked the hermit why he had traded the beautiful open Himalayan nature for 
the company of cows in this small dark room. His answer was that it didn’t 
matter since the world was an illusion anyway.



*“What you see is Maya,”* the wise man said to me from his stall. 
*“Do not mix 
reality with what you see here.
Consciousness alone exists!”*



The argument in these teachings about the illusory nature of the world is 
that everything that changes is not real. Only that which is unchanging is 
real. From this perspective, it is clear that no phenomena in time and space 
can be real.



The all-pervasive perspective of the self, of consciousness, is presented 
here in its timelessness and unchangeability as the only reality.



Indians call this timeless, unchanging state *Brahman*, or the 
universal Self. Only 
Brahman is real for the Brahmins. Brahman is defined as consciousness in 
itself.

The Eastern 
notion that human life is fundamentally suffering creates a 
longing to escape it. Hence reincarnation is a curse and the aim 
is to move away from the strenuous physical life. This can be 
achieved by meditating oneself out of earthly existence. Through 
a spiritual cleansing process, where the body's thirst for life 
is neutralized, the evil repetition of rebirths is transcended. 
The spirit is now free from physical existence.





Illusion as a Survival Response to 
Catastrophes

**Cultures are shaped by their encounters with catastrophe. How do 
a country's inhabitants deal with poverty, hunger, disease, and 
war?**


No country, perhaps except for Russia, has been subjected to as 
many regularly recurring catastrophes as Indian society. In 
Europe, we had the plague in the 14th century and the Thirty 
Years' War. In India, the monsoon has failed approximately every 
ten years for the past two thousand years, creating disasters on 
a scale that we in the West have not known.



There are geneticists who believe that, due to historically 
recurring famines, Indians have developed a special survival 
gene that allows them to live longer without food than any other 
race. On the flip side, they cannot cope with the new 
well-nourished middle-class lifestyle. Every third case of 
diabetes in the world is an Indian. Indians hold the world 
record for heart disease, especially among very young people. 
The famine gene hinders them from fully enjoying India's modern 
consumer feast of good food.



Remarkably, India is the only 'civilized' country where, during 
significant periods of history, organized cannibalism has been 
practiced as a survival strategy. Parents have eaten their 
children and vice versa to survive. When I present this 
historical evidence to Indians, they naturally deny it. During 
the great famine of 1631—paradoxically the year before Shah 
Jahan began constructing the obscenely lavish Taj Mahal, in 
stark contrast to his millions of subjects who had no clothes on 
their backs—several European travelers reported that organized sales of human flesh occurred in the 
larger cities.



The connection between suffering and hunger can be seen as far back as the 
more than 2,000-year-old Buddhist Jataka tales, which repeatedly juxtapose 
the empty stomach against the morally right action. In the tale Ingratitude 
Punished, we even witness a Bodhisattva helping to eat his brothers' wives 
in order to survive.



The last remnants of this cannibalistic culture can be found among the 
Aghoris, who can still be found in cities like Varanasi, where they live in 
graveyards and ritually consume the flesh of the dead to demonstrate that 
the world is an illusion.



An Aghori-like explanation for the construction of Indian illusion theology 
is readily apparent. In a catastrophic culture, it does not pay to invest 
life energy in a bodily 'earthly' life. Indian culture has, as a survival 
response, instead specialized in freeing consciousness from the body. Spirit 
alone exists—because the body will be gone before the morning dew has 
evaporated from the fragile reeds of life.



The Fragmentation of the Caste System

Catastrophes alone, however, do not explain the whole picture. Another 
important factor is the Indian caste system. India was (and still is) one of 
the most fragmented cultures in the world due to its caste system. Even the 
four main castes are divided into hundreds of sub-castes.



When the Afghan-Turkish Muslim Muhammad Gori stood before the gates of 
Lahore at sunset in 1192, observing the enemy army, he had to ask his 
military advisors in wonder:

"Why are there so many small fires?"



His advisors replied: "They are kitchen fires because food is being prepared 
now."

"But why in the world are there so many small fires instead of a few large 
ones like we have?"



"Because the Hindus are divided into castes. These castes cannot and will 
not eat together."



Muhammad Gori smiled and said: "Then I have won the war!"



For if people cannot eat together, they cannot fight together either. A 
warrior culture must necessarily be monotheistic in order to effectively 
expand its business empire through 'churches' and cannons.



In India, the caste system adds an additional layer of fragmentation to an 
already highly divided class society. The original word for caste is varna, 
which means color. The caste system is a form of advanced apartheid that has 
hindered dynamic social change to an extent unknown in Europe. India became 
a buffet for invaders. Due to social hyper-fragmentation, Indians could not 
keep their powder dry.



The extreme over-division of the population by the caste system made it 
impossible to mobilize a collective survival response against both war and 
volatile weather.



Catastrophes can only be tackled with solidarity and unity.



When a people have been hit by famine and/or invading armies from outside to 
such an extent and are unable to mobilize an adequate survival response, it 
makes sense to view the world as a place of suffering, where being reborn is 
not a blessing but a curse to escape.



THE BLACK DEATH OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE DECLINE OF THE INDUS 
VALLEY CIVILIZATION

**There's a Sufi adage: *"When the ego weeps for what it has 
lost, the spirit rejoices for what it has found."***


Ever since Napoleon's era, we in the West have held a deep 
admiration for ancient Egyptian culture. As an introduction to 
exploring the Indus Valley civilization, let's first make a 
detour through Egypt. Both Egyptian and Indus cultures thrived 
along rivers. Yet, a significant contrast existed in the 
reliability of their water supplies. The Nile was consistently 
reliable, unlike the ancient Saraswati River, which eventually 
dried up. How did this steady supply of food influence the 
religious beliefs in Egypt? Essentially, the Egyptians 
envisioned the afterlife as a continuation of their already 
prosperous lives. In this context, I perceive a lack of 
transcendence in Egyptian religion. Why seek to transcend 
something already perceived as ideal? Could the experience of 
loss have been a catalyst for the Indians' conceptualization of 
zero?



The Blessings of the Black Death****
In the West, our spiritual understanding hasn't always been as 
lacking as it is today. This overlooked ignorance started with 
our technological transformation of the world after the Black 
Death in the 14th century. Following the devastation of the 
plague, Europe saw a significant material advancement. It began 
with increased wages for the limited workforce and the 
subsequent adoption of automation, ultimately leading to 
Europe's scientific and technological breakthroughs.



Post-plague, we managed to ensure food on our tables, but in the 
process, we became somewhat akin to the Egyptians. As the 
English adage goes,* "There's no such thing as a free lunch."* In 
this exchange between spirit and body, we didn't achieve both 
satiation and wisdom. Bloated and complacent, we arrogantly 
considered ourselves superior to other cultures to the extent of 
believing in our right to colonize them, thereby spiritually 
dozing off like well-fed pigs.



Before the Black Death, however, the West had its share of 
spiritual beacons comparable at any time to the Eastern sages. 
After the plague we got plenty of philosophers while the rare 
breed of enfringed mystics wanished. To put it starkly, one 
could argue that the plague decimated our Western tradition of 
profound consciousness understanding and instead replaced it 
with people like Decartes with their academic worship of the 
thinking proces. Therefore I refer to our own 
pre-plague mystics. A fitting starting point to rediscover the 
lost Western thread is in the remarkable world of words of 
Meister Eckhart. Hence you will find his words all over 
Meditation.dk.




Indian non-existence****
Since the inception of their profound culture, the Indian 
civilization has delved into the realms of nothingness and 
non-existence, contrasting the ancient Greeks and subsequent 
Western societies who focused on defining and materializing 
'something'. This dichotomy is symbolized by the Western focus 
of the numeral and the
[
Indian discovery of and reverence of zero](/civilization/civilization-and-consciousness#EPILOGUE_OF_A_DREAM_-_The_Indo-Greek_Genesis_of_Nothing_).



These two distinct philosophical stances can be seen as survival 
tactics. In Western culture, we typically confront problems 
head-on. In contrast, Indian philosophy often approaches issues 
by challenging their very existence, suggesting that they are 
mere illusions or akin to dreams from which one must awaken. 
This perspective shift reduces the urgency for direct action, 
viewing the world as void and problems as mere fabrications of 
Maya.



India is filled with anecdotes highlighting this focus on 
transcendent non-existence. For instance, an Indian yogi was once giving a 
lecture on the top floor of a multi-story building in Tokyo, 
Japan. Suddenly, a small earthquake made the entire building 
tremble. People fled in panic, but the yogi remained motionless 
in his lotus position, eyes closed. When the tremors subsided 
and people returned, they asked him why he hadn't fled the 
building. He replied, *While you were fleeing out, I was fleeing 
in.*



What led the Indians to react so differently? There are 
mainly two factors of geopolitical nature. As a result of these, India has been one 
of the most catastrophe-prone regions for the past 4.000 years. 




1) The caste system's extreme fragmentation of Indian 
society.

**When Muhammad Ghori, the Islamic invader, and his army 
encamped outside the walls of Delhi at dusk, he noticed numerous 
small bonfires within the Indian army camp. His advisors explained that 
these were individual cooking fires, necessitated by the caste 
system which prevented the Indians from sharing meals. **


Ghori's realization was sharp: *"Then I have won the war!"* He 
understood that a people divided by such rigid social 
structures, unable to unite even in basic acts like eating 
together, would struggle to present a unified front in battle or 
in overcoming societal challenges. Long before the wave of 
islamic invasions, ancient Persians, Parthians, Schytians and 
Macedonian Greek benefitted from the weak military protection 
the fragmented India society was able to organize.



This fragmentation, more profound than typical class divisions, 
meant that the Indian society had inadvertently weakened itself 
from within, making it more susceptible to external domination. 
The adage 'divide and conquer' took on a new dimension here, 
where the division was self-imposed, easing the task for 
conquerors.



2) Drought

**Drought's role in Indian history is linked to a mix of weak 
state formation, the erratic nature of monsoons, and radical 
climate shifts. The lack of substantial state-backed 
infrastructure like water reservoirs, drainage, and irrigation 
systems intensified these challenges. Interestingly, early 
Indian civilizations, notably the Indus Valley culture, had the 
expertise to construct and manage such systems. However, after 
its collapse, only during the brief rule of the Buddhist Mauryan 
Empire was state-organized water management implemented for 
public benefit, to mitigate the impacts of these natural 
calamities. Consequently, periodic famines, occurring roughly 
every ten years due to either excessive rain or intense 
droughts, have been a persistent issue throughout Indian 
history.**
**I perceive this deficiency in organizing state-constructed 
protective measures for the populace as a consequence of the 
caste system's extreme fragmentation of Indian society.**



Interestingly, it appears that Indians might have developed a 
physiological adaptation, often referred to as a "starvation 
gene," which enhanced their ability to endure prolonged periods 
of hunger more effectively than other populations. This genetic 
adaptation causing a more lean body mass can be seen as a 
response to the recurring famines.




In the ensuing discussion, I aim to present the notion that 
Indians, through enduring catastrophic events, unearthed 
profound insights into consciousness, essentially finding their 
version of the holy grail in this realm.



*To win is to lose - To lose is to win

***This connection implies that our grasp and investigation of 
consciousness are significantly shaped by our historical and 
environmental contexts. Japan is another illustration of this 
influence. In Zen there is an adage as follows: *"To win is to 
lose - To lose is to win."*** **Like India, Japan was susceptible to disasters 
such as volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and devastating wars. 
Consequently, despite its material success, Japanese culture 
never lost sight of the transcendental aspect, here manifesting 
in the adoration of the ephemeral blossoming cherry tree 
moments before an abrupt demise. **


In this regard, even consciosuness is shaped as a 
prisoner of our geography, of the lands where we have dwelled 
for generations.




MEDITATION ORIGINATED AS A CALORIE SAVING SURVIVAL STRATEGY

**In India’s poorest state, Uttar Pradesh, there is still 
today a social system where holy men, sadhus, in lifelong 
wandering, settle temporarily in a village temple. In the 
temple, there is either a hermetically sealed room or a deep 
hole dug in the ground, intended for the holy man’s often 
month-long meditations. The village sees it as a great honor to 
receive such a sadhu. They are now assured of rain for their 
crops. In the event that karma has determined it will not rain, 
the sadhu’s life offers another important lesson to the 
villagers: We live in hunger and frugality, but look at the holy 
man in the hole! He is happy, yet has even less than us.**


Meditation wasn't 
solely the domain of yogis; it was also a practice embraced by 
ordinary Indians. Intriguingly, in India, meditation has always 
been a practice for both rulers and the impoverished. This 
societal reversal is illustrated by the numerous destitute 
individuals wandering around India, claiming to be sadhus who 
have renounced worldly life.



During my travels in India, I frequently encountered everyday 
people who incorporated meditation into their daily routines. 
Below is a small video recording of such individuals I captured 
in Punjab about 30 years ago:








While exploring the literature 
about the renowned Indian saint Ramakrishna, I was particularly 
struck by the accounts of his impoverished parents. During 
periods without food or water, they would simply sit down with 
closed eyes. Remaining in this state for days without caloric or 
water intake, they spontaneously entered higher states of 
consciousness, often accompanied by visions of gods and 
goddesses. This practice was common in rural India. In times of 
drought and famine, people would sit in meditation, waiting, 
perhaps to outlast the crisis. This raises a question about 
survival strategies: Who is more likely to endure longer with a 
greater chance of survival? Is it the person who depletes their 
limited resources of water and food in frantic efforts to 
improve their situation, or the one who enters a survival 
trance, conserving resources by minimizing their use?




One of the most crucial meditative 
survival adaptations is the ability to survive on minimal 
resources, with food and water being the most important. During 
periods of scarcity, Indian people would sit down for thousands of 
years, close their eyes, and enter a low-calorie mode. What were 
they doing there? They were waiting - waiting for something they 
could not control. They were waiting for the rain. In this 
state, they prolonged their chances to survive to see for better times or 
they reached a point where 
they embraced their destiny as a dream, not to be taken 
seriously. In this near-death state, as an incidental discovery, 
they unveiled what a full belly is too drowsy to recognize: the 
deeper layers of our enigmatic consciousness.



Meditation and Rain

**Across the Gangetic plain, in almost every small village, 
the villagers have constructed a modest temple, often featuring 
a small cave or a deep hole dug into the earth. These temples 
are usually unoccupied, but occasionally, a wandering holy man, 
a sadhu, passes through and is invited to stay in the temple for 
a while. During his stay, he might spend months in the hole or 
cave, engaging in spiritual practices, while the villagers take 
care of his daily physical needs. The underlying principle here 
is the firm belief that deep meditation performed by the saint 
will bring rain and prosperity. The association between rain and 
meditation dates back to ancient times. The belief holds that 
meditation, if conducted with enough intensity, will induce 
rainfall.**


I imagine a scenario in ancient Indus Valley during a drought, 
where people had no choice but to sit in a low-calorie mode, 
waiting for the rain to come. This survival practice, as often 
happens in magical thinking, may have led to a reversal in cause 
and effect, creating a belief that meditation would bring about 
rain.



Building on the context of this discussion,
[
recent research](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/article274964881.html) indicates that prolonged 100-year droughts 
were precisely what led to the downfall of the Indus Valley 
civilization around 3,600 years ago. Therefore, I am firmly 
convinced that these catastrophic periods were instrumental in 
leading the Indians to invent meditation as an integral part of 
their collective survival and cultural practices.



Later in history, under Mongol rule in India, there were ample 
reasons for these introverted practices to persist, primarily 
because the vast wealth of India was concentrated in the hands 
of a small Mongol elite. This elite, comprising only a few 
thousand individuals, held most of the country's riches, while 
the majority of the population lived with the bare minimum. This 
stark wealth disparity further justified the continuation of 
inward-focused societal survival practices. In this context, the 
Indian sadhu, or wandering monk, evolved into an expert at 
surviving with practically nothing.



Meditation in this low-calorie and water state leads to an expansion of 
consciousness in both quality and quantity. There appears to be 
an evolutionary link between brain optimization and calorie 
restriction, as in times of food scarcity, we needed to be 
smarter to survive. However, in the Indian version of 
meditation, this brain optimization is channeled into conscious 
passivity rather than hunting prey. This mechanism demonstrates 
how humans, through storytelling and intersubjective realities, 
can repurpose genetic programs in ways they weren't originally 
"intended" for. The yogi portrayed below is an extreme example 
of such cultural survival adaptations.



MEDITATION, MASTERY AND... MAGIC?

**On my trekkings in the Indian Himalayas I sometimes observed 
hermits walking naked in the snow. These ascetics were able to control and rise 
their body temperature to such an extend that they could survive 
the icy cold climate at these altitudes.

*It was my Indian trekking partner who took this photo. Out of

courtesy he only took a photo of the upper part of this naked sadhu.*


Could it be possible that the Indian investment in 
introspection could open doors into posibility rooms we could 
not even dream of?
There are many accounts from India and Tibet of yogis who could 
survive without food for extended periods, with some even 
asserting they lived entirely without sustenance. The famous 
Tibetan saint [
Milarepa](https://www.dlshq.org/saints/milarepa/) is known for his extreme austerities, including 
meditating in various caves and undergoing severe practices that 
reduced his body to a skeletal state. As part of these 
practices, he lived on nettles only for several months, adhering 
strictly to the instructions of his Guru and developing various 
spiritual abilities​​.



Years ago in Hoshiarpur, I encountered
[Ramesh Giri](meditation_and_living_without_food.htm), 
a retired government official residing quietly in a small town 
near Hoshiarpur. He had dedicated much of his free time since 
early youth to meditation, never acting as a Guru or 
accumulating followers. Only
[Bharadwaj](meditator_sag_%20bharadwaj.htm) and a 
select few were aware of his remarkable capability: to live 
without food or water.

*Ramesh Giri*




Whether these stories are true or not is 
not the main concern. What matters is that they emphasize the 
cultural and historical significance of surviving on minimal calorie intake.



Echoing the Zen Buddhist adage once more:




*"To lose is to win, and to win 
is to lose."*




During Freud's era, sexuality was 
repressed, relegated to the subconscious. Today, spirituality 
faces a similar fate, being marginalized and often viewed as 
contrary to rational thinking. Following this unconventional 
neural pathway, I encountered an unusual variation of the 
Freudian slip:




"The higher you 
fall, the deeper you fly."




This encapsulates exactly what the 
Indians accomplished.



Their contribution to global thought has been largely 
underappreciated. This is inherently characteristic of zero – to 
be unnoticed, yet fundamentally significant.



Now it's time to revisit Rudyard Kipling's saying:




*"East is East, and West is 
West,

and never the twain shall meet."*




This phrase remains relevant in 
the context that numbers and zero represent two qualitatively 
different realities, and therefore, can never truly converge. 
However, their combined functionality has enabled the creation 
of technology, such as computers, which I use to write this 
text.



The Indian sage Data Dayal composed an addition to this line 
during his 1930s visit to the USA:




"East is East 
and West is West.

However, one day the East will serve

the West a grand Spiritual feast!"




You are invited!
