MEDITATION TECHNIQUES



*

'He who seeks God in some way (read meditation technique 
or ritual),

grasps the way and loses God, who dwells in the way. But he who seeks 
God without a way, grasps God and lives with the Son.'*

[Meister Eckhart - Doctor Ecstaticus](/western-mystics)*



'Man has to seek God in error, forgetfulness and foolishness.'
* 
Meister Eckhart




* 'If you want to succeed,
double your failure rate.'
*[
Thomas J. Watson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson)




Thanks to the Hippies

**Through the time of the hippies in the '70s, the East began to influence the 
West. The Beatles 
started practicing [
meditation](https://www.tm.org/homepage-2?va-red=NzkyOTo5NTk2) under the guidance of an Indian guru, leading to a gigantic 
cultural 'experimentarium' with far greater importance than even their music. 
Valuable cultural information from around the globe is now synthesized into a 
new life stream of global culture, thanks to exponential advances in travel and 
information sharing.**


I lived in sync with that flight of Icarus, where some got lost in drugs and 
others in extreme political activism. Amidst this mix, there was also gold. I 
grew up as a teenager worshipping Jimi Hendrix on my solo guitar, and I had hair 
long enough to sit on. Today, I am bald. The only thing that survived all these 
years was meditation and breathing techniques. I am so thankful for that!



Prologue****
What did India learn us? Anyone who has experienced the traffic 
in an Indian mega-city will come to know: In the midst of chaos, 
just relax!



An English proverb says: *"God takes care of the ignorant."* 
By embracing a sense of foolishness within yourself, the body's 
self-improving intelligence is activated. In this sense, 
meditation is fundamentally not a scientific endeavor. This does 
not mean that meditation is anti-scientific, but rather that it 
involves completely different parts of the brain, which are 
often, though not always, inversely proportional in size due to 
evolutionary trade-offs.



Our mainstream Western societies worship science, and with good 
reason. Science and reason have brought us to our current living 
standards, which, despite their imperfections, are better 
overall than those of any other culture in history. For those 
who doubt this, I urge you to read world history back to ancient 
times.



However, the blessing of scientific thinking came with a curse. 
When scientists began to lead the investigation into meditation 
and/or psychedelics, they became like priests or gurus in a 
culture where science and reason have replaced God within the 
same system of blind worship. Just as leaders of cults or any 
other organized religions are often the least spiritual people, 
we now have a collective of rational minds, often with little or 
no capability and wisdom to live in meditation, taking a 
significant lead in formulating what meditation is.



Why do I mention this here? It is because, in actual meditation, 
there is nothing to understand. In fact, rational thinking must 
be rational enough to shut itself down—not forever and in all 
matters—but it must recognize that there are other highly 
intelligent non-verbal systems within the wonder of the human 
brain-body that know all about how to meditate. We need to step 
down from the throne of understanding for these systems to 
meditate for us.



I am not at all against science, but reason must know itself and 
its limitations in a self-aware loop and then be clever enough 
to allow something else to take over. You go to a dentist (a 
profession that, by the way, was perfected through science) when 
you have tooth problems. You surrender to the expertise of the 
dentist in the sense that you do not need to understand every 
move they make.



In meditation, you surrender to your inner tour guide. He will 
take you on the profound journey of not understanding.



*
"In unknowing knowing shall we know God."

[Meister Eckhart](/western-mystics)




Meditation is a Lifelong Project

**Meditation takes your entire life and gives it back to you in a new 
form.**


Of all the things I have done in my life, I consider the moment I 
discovered meditation as a young man the most fortunate event. It 
evolved into a wonderful journey marked by error, forgetfulness, and 
foolishness, leading me to a life in old age where I can now sum it all 
up in one simple word:




'Gratefulness.'





![](/images/tommedi3.jpg)






WHAT TECHNIQUE SHOULD I USE?****

**What is now the best meditation 
technique in order to arrive in that promised land of peace and 
thankfulness? I would say all techniques and none of them. I've tried 
most of them, but essentially, I arrived in that state by sitting 
alertly with closed eyes and doing nothing. **


Let me state that I have not reached that advertized state of 
enlightenment. However, what I have gained is so much better than the 
state I was in ten years ago, twenty years ago, and so on. My life 
gradually became better and deeper, allowing me now in old age to be 
here and state: It is wonderful to be 
alive!




Listen to what Franz Kafka has to say:




*"You need not do anything. Just remain 
at your table and listen.

You don't even need to listen, just wait. You don't even need to wait,

just learn to be quiet, still, and alone. And existence will come to you 
by itself

and offer itself to you. It has no choice; it will roll in ecstasy at 
your feet."*




Here, in that potent passiveness, I 
realized that the repetition of mantras is in danger of running in 
circles, leading internally to a state not much different from the 
societal alienation described in Kafka's books.



For the one who sits with what is, without doing anything, not even 
using a meditation technique, everything will be given in the form of 
fine-tuned intuitions from within. These tiny, blessed 'innerstandings,' 
as Sunyata would say, will light up the next step on the path.



This refined, innerstood intuition might, in fact, urge you to repeat a 
mantra or play with any meditation technique, but now that very same 
practice is not dictated by the ever-controlling mind. So, as long as 
you spontaneously enjoy your routines, they can 
definitely make a difference.




Meister Eckhart states that God prefers 
great mistakes over small ones. Following our interoceptive 
innerstandings is also the true path of divine errors. Good advice makes 
the head more clever, helping you avoid pitfalls. Mistakes, on the other 
hand, make the body wiser. That is why I see and feel my wisdom sitting 
like stargates in the scars of my inner body. These wonderful scars are 
what I got walking mindlessly in blindfolded trust.

THE RESTLESS MIND**




*"You are irritated by every rub,
how will your mirror be polished?"**
*Rumi




I've often experienced impatience in myself and others. This 
impatience does nothing but put the cart before the horse. In this 
context, I think of Napoleon's famous words:




"Dress me slowly, for 
I am in a hurry!"




The Catarpillar-Ego

**This impatience stems from our mind. 
However, the thinking-based ego-mind cannot become spiritual in the same 
way that a caterpillar cannot become a butterfly. The point is, the 
caterpillar dies on a cellular level in the process where the butterfly 
unfolds. Not a single caterpillar cell gets the honor and joy of 
becoming part of a butterfly. It is not the caterpillar that becomes a 
butterfly. It is something that has transcended the cellular life of a 
caterpillar. At the point of metamorphosis, both the caterpillar and the 
butterfly produce poison to kill each other. The caterpillar-mind lives 
in the world of meditation techniques, and therefore, at a certain 
point, these techniques become poison for the unfoldment of your 
spiritual life.**



The mind in search of gurus, retreats, and more advanced meditation 
techniques is like a caterpillar-person putting on fake butterfly wings 
and convincing itself and the world that it is the butterfly of the 
soul.



Therefore, at some point, we have to give up spiritualizing ourselves. 
As ego-driven humans, we are caterpillars—nothing more and nothing wrong 
in that. One day, a 
butterfly will be born in us, but we will not witness the birth. For the 
birth itself is our death:




*"You must be willing to burn yourself 
in your own flame;

how could you rise again if you have not first become ashes?"

*Friedrich Nietzsche




I know such statements do not sell 
tickets. But I'm not interested in selling meditation techniques anyhow 
because they are created by an ego-mind that wants to spiritualize 
itself through understanding and control.



The Business of Spirituality

**The restless 'Californicated' Western mind loves ideas like 
self-improvement. In this sense, meditation techniques have become a 
kind of commodification of spirit. The more techniques are seen as 
important, the more there is to sell in the form of courses, retreats, 
mantras, and self-development.**


What is the essence of life? It is peace and love. Can you buy love from 
a prostitute? No, you cannot. Can you buy true peace on a meditation 
course with a famous guru? No, you cannot. As long as we are all clear 
about the conditions, there is, as far as I am concerned, nothing wrong 
with prostitution or paid retreats. We must, however, realize that these 
gratifications are for our caterpillar life only. And at some stage, we 
are all caterpillars.



That is why Meister Eckhart says:




"Merchants go when the 
truth appears,

for the truth needs no merchanting.

Behold thy temple cleared of merchants."




My friend Johannes from Zurich, who is a 
practicing Buddhist and fluent in Tibetan, says: *"Om mani padme hum" 
has turned into "Om money give me soon."*



The Quantification of the Soul****
A fundamental layer upon which the commodification of the soul takes 
place is the modern tendency of 'protocollizing' oneself. YouTube is 
full of young, sporty American men advocating for all kinds of 
overcomplicated meditation and breathing protocols that make them 
important and the listener lost. The mind invents all sorts of 
quantifiable agents like: do this technique for so many minutes in this 
specific way and breathe while counting 4-7-8 or 7-7 or whatever.




Now listen 
to what Meister Eckhart has to say on this matter:




"This spirit knows no 
time nor number:

number does not exist apart from the malady of time."




One of the challenges with turning 
meditation into a tool is that the soul is entirely valueless, 
understood as value-less. It is devoid of value in the sense that it 
is the unotized agent like a screen in a cinema that gives all other 
things value. Hence our soul cannot be trained like a 
bodybuilder's muscles. It is already perfect, but we left it when 
we went out to improve it.



Listen with this in mind to Rumi:




"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find 
all

the barriers within yourself that you have built against it."




One such barrier is the adoration 
of techniques. While quantifying our spiritual practice seems 
rational, it removes us from the most vital aspect of 
meditation: the ability to sit in spontaneous communion with our 
vigilant awareness and feel—sense—listen to all the wordless and 
ever-morphing landscapes of micro sensations taking place in our 
interoceptive body realm. In fact, it is these various minuscule 
signals from the multiple operative systems within us that need 
our space-holding attention to guide us to the next breath we 
take or the next move we make. These archaic operative systems 
do not understand the language of words and numbers. Most of them were
[invented 
by evolution](/consciousness/consciousness-and-evolution) long before we were able even to growl.



This path of inner attentive sensing without agendas is a much murkier, 
muddier, and more organic way to approach meditation. It is a creative 
process, an art form where you and your life become a living piece of 
art.




*"When you do things from your soul, 


you feel a river moving in 
you, a joy."

*Rumi





Every Truth is Half-Baked

**Having said that, I now have to contradict myself. For every 
viewpoint sees only part of the truth. In this sense, meditation is soul 
surfing on a life ocean full of clashing waves. Spiritual growth is not 
linear and is full of paradoxes. It is each soul's task to surf the 
balance between them. Otherwise, the opposite of what we cling to will 
always turn out to be the truth that hits us out of balance.**


In accordance, I must be vigilant enough not to judge the business of 
spiritual commodification with resentment. Everything is, in fact, 
perfectly imperfect, or maybe even so that imperfection is as needed as 
perfection. How can we learn to soul-surf if we are not constantly 
thrown off the board?

EFFORTLESSNESS IN MEDITATION**



*"The non-existent can penetrate where there is no space.**
Therefore, I recognize the value of non-action.

To learn without words and work without accomplishing,

few understand this."

*Tao Teh King, Lao Tzu - 43



In my youth, I learned to practice 
Transcendental Meditation. Nowadays I rarely meditate the TM way. However, I am 
eternally grateful for receiving the most vital meditation 
advice at an early age. The TM teachers kept repeating: Do not 
use effort in your meditation. What marvelous advice!



In accordance with that glorious advice, I would like to 
radicalize it even further and postulate:



We are not able to meditate!



I remember one day arriving at New 
Delhi airport. I observed a group of Western senior meditators 
with one hand in a small bag containing a little chain of beads. 
They were constantly counting these beads while internally 
repeating mantras to concentrate their minds. They looked tired 
and dried out. Joy had left them together with their youth, and 
now all they seemed to have left was the grumpy counting that 
kept them away from a question they should have asked themselves 
a long time ago, a question that would be harder and harder to 
confront with each passing year of joyless self-discipline: Have 
I wasted my life in joyless repetition?



Meditation is a happening, not something you do. For our old 
ego-operating system, which is used to eating bread by the sweat 
of its face, the fact that meditation only works without effort 
is very difficult to relate to. Our culture has difficulty 
understanding that you can achieve more by doing less.



Therefore, I say: If your meditation practice does not give you 
solace, peace, and joy here and now, then drop it for God's 
sake. There is only a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow that 
makes you marvel at its colors at any given time.



I also repeat in joyful flow: We cannot 
meditate. It is impossible.



To be Meditated

**That we, as ego-entities, are not 
able to meditate is, however, not contradictory to meditation as 
such. In the realization that we cannot meditate, we can relax 
and allow ourselves to be meditated. This is an effortless 
process. In [Sunyata's words](/inspirators/sunyata), it is a happening in 
*'joyous ease.'* 
We could also say that to sit in joyous meditation is to sit 
with grace, and in grace, we are removed from all work. As we 
fall in love, we can also fall into meditation.



"The bird of 
paradise lands only on the hand that does not grasp."**
— Zen Proverb



"God is in all things, urging us to give up our will."

— Meister Eckhart



Make as little effort as possible 
in meditation. In my experience, this sentence contains the most 
important meditation teaching. Remember the Zen proverb:



*"Sitting quietly, doing 
nothing, spring comes, and the grass grows by itself."

*

Let me repeat like mantra: Let yourself be meditated. 
Allow meditation to come to you; let it be a spontaneous, 
natural process that the mind engages in simply because it 
enjoys it. Let yourself be meditated!



Meditation becomes stiff when driven by conscious willpower. 
When you actively chase the butterfly of the soul, you cannot 
catch it. Only when you sit completely still, perhaps after 
giving up the chase, might you be lucky enough for it to land on 
your hand.



The "I," understood as the outward 
ego-driven personality-interface, is as bad at meditating 
as a cart is at pulling a horse.



An effortless Effort

**What can be done, however, is to be meditated. Do an effort 
to let yourself be meditated!**


Let me give you an analogy. You take your little boat and row it 
out and away from the shore and into the ocean. Then you put up 
the sails of the boat, and by that act, you cannot do more. Now 
all that is left is to wait for grace to fill your sails with 
the breath of God. When that wind is breathing from within, you 
have no doubt that a power much greater than you is doing 
meditation on you.



A group of fellow Sufi travelers was dancing in celebration of 
God's glory at sunset. They were singing over and over that all 
is God's will only. The next day they discovered that their 
camels had run away. So the Sufis say: Yes, all is God's will 
but remember to tie your camels!



So you have to tie your camels and row your boat to the place 
where the wind can catch you.



**To be meditated, I must do something. This is a paradox 
I leave open for you to live. For the dynamically fragile truth lies in the 
cracks between theses and antitheses. The wonderful 
[Manav Dayal](radha_soami_meditation.htm) 
said to me:



*"The Highest can only be reached through an effortless effort."*



So let me conclude by 
contradicting the first section: You must make an effort if you 
want to proceed further in the text. You might not get far in meditation without 
a little self-discipline.**


The Will You Need to Mobilize Does Not Exist

**However, allow me to look a bit beyond these stories about 
effort and non-effort. At the beginning of your journey, you 
imagine that you at least have to row your boat, set your sails, 
or tie your camels in the oasis in the desert. Looking back a 
bit longer on your path, you might realize that even these 
actions were not your own. Free will is, in fact, a wonderful 
illusion. Once your awareness becomes a bit more vigilant, it 
will look through the veils of will and perceive everything as 
processed by holy algorithms.

**The Graceful Epilogue of free 
will

**How can all this meditation be effortless effort? One way of 
answering that could be with a quote from Thomas Edison:* "I 
never did a day's hard work in my life. It was all fun."* The 
same Edison also said, *"There is no substitute for hard 
work."***


I would go a step further and declare: You cannot do meditation 
unless you are called from within to do it. Meditation is grace.




TO BE CLEANSED FROM EGO-DRIVEN WILL

**We are deeply accustomed to be in charge and in this proces we 
combine insight with action. 
We are used to the idea that we must do something to get 
something and in this process we need to understand things 
before we act.
Our entire external survival apparatus has been trained from 
childhood to obey 'the necessary.' It’s about doing something, 
becoming something, ideally becoming number one!
By understanding and then doing things, we transform the world into tools. By using 
these tools, we achieve 'something.'



Meditation, by contrast, is about being passively aware 
without striving to do or understand anything. That by itself 
contradicts everything we have learnt since the first mammoth 
hunt and much before. This habit of being in charge is so strong 
that in order to reach the sweet flow zone spot between 
intention and non-intention, most of us first of all need to 
embark on a journey

of meditative let go. Here we will sink into that blessed well of 
bewilderment, where everything we believed in and took ourselves 
to be will questioned. Just a fingersnap second in this inner 
death lead to a rebirth of who we take ourselves to be.



Meditation, if practiced in 
courage and 
freedom from organized religions and techniques, will 
deconstruct 
our prefabricated perceptions of what reality is and leave us in 
a new and fresh world where, in William James' words, we will 
re-experience *everything in a state of blooming, buzzing 
confusion.*



This will, however, not lead to passivity! Action happens 
spontaneously and effortlessly in awareness and consciousness of 
the [soul-surfer.](/love/the-super-awake-flow)



For this to occur, it is important that any insight or 
meta-insight into your behavior is NOT followed by guilt or 
sharp divisions of what is good or bad.



You perceive and realize yourself supported by trust and 
non-judgment.

Meditative meta-insight occurs in the clear light of love, where 
there is nothing to change. Everything happens on its own in a 
transformation process beyond your control.




Best regards,

Gunnar Mühlmann
