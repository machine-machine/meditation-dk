THE INNER AND THE OUTER PERSON **

*"God has given you one face, 
**
and you make yourself another."

*— William Shakespeare

If you ask me, *"Who are you?"

*I would respond, *"I am me."*



Notice something interesting: You addressed 'me,'** but it 
was **'I'** who answered. Before** 'I'** spoke, there was a pause—a 
moment of reflection.**


What did 'I**' reflect on? Myself? Or perhaps... **'me'**?**


What can we infer from this brief, fictional dialogue? First and 
foremost, we can deduce that we are composed of two entities: an 
'I**' and a '**me.**' Secondly, the dialogue suggests 
that '**I**' 
serves as the representative of '**me**' in the external world.



![](/images/minime.jpg)

**
*[Me** and 
**I**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-Me)*

In this exploration, 
I will define 
**'me'** as follows:**


• An inner person,** grounded in the body through 
sensations and emotions. These instinctual sensory perceptions 
are registered in awareness, as 
[described on 
Meditation.dk](/consciousness/defining-awareness-consciousness). The body's interoceptive system functions as 
an antenna, receiving and processing these signals. This is **
'Me.'** **'Me'** experience itself through the ancient 
evolutionary mechanisms embedded within us. It is the cumulative 
sum of all biological beings that have, in some form, survived 
and evolved within us since the pre-Cambrian sea. The biological 
circuits comprising **'me'** are varied and, due to their 
different evolutionary ages, often operate out of sync. What 
unifies them as **'me's'** are their ancient lack lack of 
language and self-reflection. **'Me'** operates instinctively 
because it predates the evolution of reflective cognition.**


And 'I**' as:**


• An outer person**, interacting with both the external 
world and **'me'** using language, reason, and feelings. In this 
context, 'feelings' are defined according to modern psychology as 
sensory signals and emotions interpreted and narrated by '**I**.' Thus, '**I**' 
becomes a socially driven intro- and extrovert storyteller, weaving narratives for 
the world and for myself about '**me**.' This system unfolds in 
consciousness ([as defined on the site](/consciousness/defining-awareness-consciousness)), and although slower 
than **'me'**, it 
has gained the advantage of language-based cognition.**


Ocram's Razor Dualism

**Broadly speaking, the distinction between '**I**' and '**me**' builds 
upon the age-old dichotomy of emotion and reason, yet here we 
see it connected to the vastly different operating systems of 
[consciousness](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia) and 
[awareness](/consciousness/the-mystery-of-awareness). 


In reality, the interaction 
between **'I' **and **'me'** is highly complex—consider 
symbolic thinking, dream sequences, and visions, which bridge 
both realms. However, this dualistic model offers us an 
[Ockham's 
razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor), providing a precise conceptual cut through this organic 
complexity.**


This distinction between 'I**' (the outer, rational self) and '**me**' 
(the inner, emotional self) echoes 
[William James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James)'s ideas. As an 
early psychologist, James differentiated between the "**I**" as 'the 
self as knower' and the "**Me**" as 'the self as known.' 
This mirrors how contemporary psychology views the self: both an 
active agent (the **"I"**) and an object of awareness 
and consciousness (the **"me"**).**


Now a question arises: *Am I me? *



Out of mutible reasons it is not possible to give a satisfactory 
answer to this question. Nevertheless 'I' will serve this question as a 
subcurrent for you to ponder through the whole chapter. Here is 
the first stream of the current:



'I'** Live in an Apartment... **'Me'** Lives in My Body... The Body 
is** 'Me's'** Home.**


'I'** now repeat to myself the question you asked me at the 
beginning:**


*Who am 'I'**?***


The simplest answer, again: I** am **me.****
'I'** am not **'I'**, but **'me'**. **


Or is that really true? 'I'** might just pretend to be 
**'me'**. **


Another question is: Who or what is that 'me'**? Is there a core 
we could call **'me'**? My core truth seems to be closer to **
'me'** 
than to **'I'**, but does it give meaning to talk about an 
essential **'me', **a true self or an inner core? Before we 
procede with the** 'I'** & **'me'**-duality we need to 
addres the following question:**
Is there something we could call a true and essential 
individuality?


IS THERE ANYTHING 
AUTHENTIC IN 'ME'?

*Who am I?* Both 
modern science and ancient Indian Buddhist philosophy suggest that the 
concept of an "authentic self" may be an illusion. Yet, like 
"redness," which cannot be measured or weighed but still holds 
meaning in human consciousness, the idea of self, though 
seemingly illusory, serves a profound purpose. The same can be said of free 
will—abstract, perhaps, but integral to our experience of being.



Even when acknowledging the potential illusion of individuality 
and identity, it remains meaningful to characterize 
individuality as a dynamic 
[flow-state](/love/the-super-awake-flow). 
Our true nature, then, becomes the most deeply felt and 
consciously realized balance point among the conflicting 
impulses and inner voices that make up our psychological and 
biological existence.



The Scientific 
Drive to**** 
Substatiate Existence

**
[Lord Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kelvin), 
the influential 19th-century physicist and engineer, once said:

"When you can 
measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, 
you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, 
when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a 
meagre and unsatisfactory kind."

Though scientific philosophy has 
evolved significantly since the heyday of logical positivism, 
this type of rigid empiricism remains embedded within the 
framework of modern science. It lingers, much like a 
subconscious trauma from childhood, influencing the way we 
approach and understand the world. From here it penetrates 
psychology and even social sciences**


This mindset — which seeks to reduce all phenomena to measurable 
quantities — can be limiting when applied to the question of 
individuality or the self. How many grams does the soul weigh? 
The laboratory's pursuit of tangible evidence for individuality, 
while valuable in specific contexts, reflects a deep-seated bias 
that favors solidity as the primary criterion for existence.



The [hard problem of 
consciousness](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia)—which asks how subjective experiences arise 
from physical processes—mirrors the scientific struggle to 
substantiate existence through empirical measurement. Just as 
individuality defies reduction to quantifiable data, 
consciousness resists being fully explained by neural activity 
alone, pointing to the limitations of a strictly materialist 
approach. This parallels the broader challenge of acknowledging 
realities like the "self" that, while not directly measurable, 
are undeniably integral to human experience.



In summary, the scientific approach has been invaluable in many 
domains, but it falters when addressing subjective, experiential 
phenomena.



In this light, the urge to define the "self" as a fixed, 
unchangeable entity not only becomes unnecessary but ultimately 
restrictive. Rather than searching for a soul that can be 
captured, weighed, or quantified, it is more apt to 
conceptualize individuality as a dynamic equilibrium within a 
biological network. This network stretches back to the 
primordial beginnings of life in the pre-Cambrian seas, 
extending forward to the complex interweaving of emotions, 
cognition, and consciousness that define modern human 
experience.



The subjective but authentic experience of flow embodies this 
dynamic equilibrium—a state where our diverse biological systems 
harmonize and work together, much like a democratic society 
where every voice, even the minority, is heard and respected as 
part of the decision-making process.



The Deeper 
the Flow, the Truer the Glow and the more Real I feel

**Our sense of genuine 
individuality is intimately tied to this experience of flow. The 
deeper, more profound, and expansive the point of balance, the 
more it resonates with the deepest, oldest, and most unconscious 
layers of our cellular existence. The more we feel, see, and 
listen into the dark evolutionary abyss inside of us, the more 
the
[
Nietzschean “monsters” within us](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/18463-whoever-fights-monsters-should-see-to-it-that-in-the) smile—and as they do, the 
more meaningful and essential our sense of self becomes.**


By "deep," I refer to consciousness' ability to bring awareness 
to the most hidden, primal aspects of our biology. This is the 
path of true introspection.



Paradoxically, this inward journey toward the true, fluctuating 
self makes life’s external actions remarkably tangible: every 
word and action matters. Each small movement in life either 
brings us closer to or pulls us further from the deep 
flow-feeling of purpose. In this sense, I am not a fixed thing 
but a dynamic state—much like the experience of "redness" or the 
subjective feeling of freedom.



In the end, perhaps the question is not whether I am 
'solidifyable', but whether I am in touch with the dynamic flow 
of me. The deeper I allow myself to venture into the shifting 
currents of my being, the more vividly I can experience life as 
a living process—ever-changing, always in motion. It is in 
embracing this fluidity that I find my true authenticity, not as 
something fixed or predetermined, but as an ever-evolving state 
of becoming. The higher I flow, the deeper I glow.



A NEW 'I' AND AN OLD 'ME'

**Having defined what constitutes true individual essence, 
it's now essential to anchor this concept within the 'I' and 
'me' duality. It is highly meaningful to view this deeply 
personal balance as a dialectical dance between the two. 'You' 
and 'us' are also key dancers in this broader play, but for now, 
we'll focus on 'I' and 'me.'**


In reality, the boundary between 'I' and 'me' is not as 
clear-cut as it might seem. In essence, 'me' can be understood 
as a collective term for older, instinctual biological systems, 
while 'I' refers to the newer cognitive systems that have 
evolved over time—from the primordial seas to the present. 
Together, these form the composite of what we call the human 
being, viewed through the lens of evolutionary bio-psychology.

Our outer 'I'-personality is, in more than one sense, 
superficial. The brain can be compared to a tree in its 
evolutionary development. The deeper we go into the brain, the 
older its "rings" become. Deeply buried at its core, in the 
brainstem, lies the 'me,' representing the evolutionarily older 
and ancient layers of the brain. The outermost and newest part 
is the cerebral cortex.



In the cerebral cortex, specifically in the neocortex and 
primarily the frontal lobes, lies what defines us most as human. 
This is the command center of our most recently evolved, 
conscious awareness. From here, [commanding neurons send messages 
to the control centers in the primal brain.](/consciousness/consciousness-and-evolution#THE_BRAINS_TRIUNE_DISAGREEMENT_) Our wild, 
ancestral [Fenrir wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenrir) 
or even deeper, the
[Indian reptile 
Kundalini snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini), is, in brain mythology, bound by these neural 
threads.



When we hide or control our instincts, we simultaneously conceal 
our oldest biological layers. Our essence, our “me,” is hidden 
in the depths. To be a deep person means to be in contact with 
these oldest layers of the brain. Self-control leads to behavior 
that, like a layer of civilizing lacquer, varnishes over the 
inner animals.

The Inner Bodily Being

**Deep within the dark spaces of the body, centered around the 
abdomen, we carry a small, sensitive, childlike, instinctual 
creature. It has direct sense-based instinctual contact with the 
outside world way before we as 'I' have. Let me give a short 
example: Someone in a social gathering craks a joke about you. 
Everybody, including you, laugh. The next morning your 'I' comes 
to realise that 'me' did not like the joke. In fact, me did not 
understand the joke a all, but 'me' sensed the carrier wave of 
micro-aggressive emotion in it.**


This inner bodily being is 'me'. 'Me' is ancient and, in that sense, 
more of a hybrid being than a person. This inner being thrives on and 
exists within what on this site is defined as
[awareness](/consciousness/the-mystery-of-awareness). 
Meditation.dk consistently distinguishes between
['awareness' and 
'consciousness'](/consciousness/defining-awareness-consciousness). Although all sensations and emotions are 
products of brain activity, they are subjectively experienced in 
the body's inner space. As mentioned, these sensations are 
registered in awareness; they are noticed before being 
consciously recognized by the 'I'.



Our connection to 'me' happens instinctively through attention. Attention, in its purest form, is wordless, while 
consciousness is inextricably tied to language and reflection. A 
split second later, 'I' translates this awarenes consciously and, therefore, also 
in verbal form.

Total Recall 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Recall_(1990_film))

'Me' as Biochemical Sensations

**Now the challenge arises: Can we describe 'me' before 'I' 
interprets it through language and culturally accepted norms? 
For instance, what is the raw sensation of love before it was 
ever named or categorized?**


'I', 'Me', and Language

**In this exploration, it is the conscious 'I', the outer 
person, that interprets the 'me' through the tool of language. 
Language, invented by 'I', serves as a means of external 
communication, allowing us to plan and coordinate complex 
survival strategies with others. As language evolved, so did our 
capacity for internal thought, turning our thoughts into a form 
of heard language, shaped by the sounds we use in speech.**


As mentioned,
'me' stretches from a child’s undeveloped sense of identity back 
to our evolutionary history, where 'me' is more like a wordless, 
sensing creature. It resides in the bodily darkness, from the 
pelvic floor to the throat, experienced as bundles of 
biochemical sensations. When processed by 'I', these sensations 
are translated into feelings such as joy, anger, fear, or love, 
stored in 'I's linguistic archive. The task of 'I' is to name 
and give form to these raw sensations.



However, 'me' exists in a state of wordless attention, abstract 
bundles of sensations and emotions, unique to each individual. 
The sensational aspect of 'me' is evolutionarily much older than 
its emotional counterpart.



When 'me' is accessed through meditative awareness and 
consciousness, we can trace 
the process backward—from feeling to emotion to raw 
sensation—before 'I'-consciousness interferes with its usual 
interpretation. In this state, 'I' must invent new language, 
often in the form of pictures and symbols, to approach 
understanding this unknown territory. Dreams serve as an example 
of this symbolic language.



Take, for example, a friend of mine who, during an LSD session, 
experienced a meat-eating plant growing in his stomach. This 
image represented the second brain in his gut, trying to 
communicate that 'me' was displeased with how his 'I' was 
treating him. One take away here is that the greater the dissonance between 'me' and 'I' 
is, 
the more profound the unhappiness and depression.



The unfoldment of an Iconic Language

**AAnother key insight suggests the possibility of what could 
be termed an iconic language, capable of reaching deeper into 
the ancient "me" layers of our psyche. This is the realm of 
symbolic thinking, explored through dreams, psychedelics, and 
even in practices like astrology and tarot. These modes of 
interaction communicate with our inner self, bypassing 
conventional language and speaking directly to parts of our 
being that are older and more primal.**


For example, when people use tarot cards, they engage in a 
symbolic dialogue with their subconscious. The archetypal 
imagery in each card taps into collective human experiences and 
emotions that transcend the boundaries of spoken language. 
Whether or not one believes in the predictive power of tarot, 
the process itself facilitates a deeper connection to intuition 
and inner wisdom.



Astrology, too, operates on a symbolic plane, and in this 
context, it matters little whether its claims are scientifically 
"true." The signs, planets, and houses in astrology represent 
various facets of the human experience and psyche, providing 
individuals with a framework to explore themselves. The meaning 
people derive from it is rooted in the symbolic connections they 
make, much like interpreting a dream where a snake might 
symbolize transformation or danger, depending on one's personal 
or cultural associations.



Historically, symbolic thinking permeated ancient and medieval 
worldviews. In ancient cultures, the flight of birds or the 
movement of the stars was imbued with meaning, seen as direct 
communication from the gods. Medieval society viewed comets as 
omens of impending change, while sacred texts, religious 
rituals, and alchemical symbols were understood not just as 
literal facts but as guides to deeper spiritual truths. The 
symbolic language of these eras connected people to the 
mysteries of life in a way that rational discourse could not.



Dreams, too, remain one of the most profound forms of symbolic 
thinking, offering insights through imagery rather than logic. 
The work of Carl Jung highlights this, as he believed that dream 
symbols arise from the collective unconscious, containing 
universal archetypes—figures like the hero, the shadow, or the 
mother—that speak to our deepest psychological and emotional 
states.



In all of these examples, symbolic thinking has the power to 
evoke a felt sense of meaning and purpose that conventional 
language often struggles to articulate. Whether through the 
images of tarot cards, the astrological map of the stars, or the 
potent symbols in our dreams, this iconic language reaches parts 
of ourselves that are otherwise inaccessible, bridging the gap 
between the rational 'I' and the instinctual 'me.'



A new Symbolic Language in which 'I' can Understand 'me'

**Let us now explore the potential for creating a new symbolic 
language as an extension of the 'I's' vocabulary of feelings and 
sensations. I will illustrate this shift from conventional 
language to the realm of imagination and symbolism:**


There are countless ancient parts of 'me' that are felt but 
remain wordless. In line with the earlier example of LSD-induced 
imagery, let’s consider how a particular sensed 
configuration—perhaps an almost electric, tingling sensation in 
the torso—could be symbolized as an inner jellyfish or, 
depending on the perceived intensity of threat, a Portuguese 
man-of-war. The jellyfish, with its soft and flowing body, might 
represent a state of vulnerability, its center pulsating in the 
primordial sea of the abdomen, connected to our oldest emotional 
and physical instincts. However, when 'me' feels threatened or 
angry, this vulnerable creature transforms into a more defensive 
figure—a man-of-war, with its tentacles charged and ready for 
combat.



This metaphor illustrates how symbolic thinking enables us to 
externalize and give form to sensations that are otherwise 
elusive, providing 'I' with a richer, more nuanced vocabulary to 
describe the inner workings of 'me.' Through this symbolic 
imagery, we bridge the gap between raw sensation and conscious 
understanding, allowing us to navigate and articulate the 
complexities of our emotional landscapes.



This experiment in symbolic language expands 'I's' ability to 
engage with 'me' on its own terms, recognizing the dynamic, 
often subconscious layers of experience that conventional 
language cannot fully capture.

![](/images/folesansmed.jpg)

C.G.Jung and the Jungian 
school after him have in the exploration of archetypes and 
myths made familiar theories. However, there is a great 
difference

THE SURVIVAL OF 'ME'

**Within us lie ancient survival systems, inherited from our 
evolutionary past. These instinctive circuits continuously 
evaluate external inputs with one core question: Is there a 
threat? Will I survive?**


The inner person operates its own survival systems, with the 
greatest strength being their instinctual speed. However, what 
it gains in speed, it sacrifices in creativity. These older 
systems, suited for simpler environments, struggle to cope with 
the complexities of modern life, which require more nuanced 
responses.



This is where the outer person comes into play. The inner person 
is protected and regulated by a reflective, slower outer person, 
bridging the gap between instinct and the demands of 
contemporary life.



The Guard

**The primary role of the outer 
person is to safeguard the inner 'me'. The 'I’s task is to 
ensure the survival of the inner being by using a broader 
repertoire of thoughtful, verbalized strategies.**


The outer person acts like a knight in armor, guiding the inner 
"primitive" creature through life’s dangers. The sensations of 
the inner me inform whether to attack, flee, or wait. The knight 
also considers whether these reactions are appropriate.



The outer person wields reason as its most powerful tool. This 
ability to control impulses, analyze situations, and communicate 
improves me’s survival chances. While me’s instincts are quick, 
they often fall short in navigating the complexities of modern 
life.




The Outer Person's Dual Role

**The outer person plays a dual role, much like an actor. On 
one hand, it performs the life that the modern control society 
has programmed into us, while on the other hand, it acts as a 
parent, protecting and guiding the inner person. The mask serves 
both as a tool for survival in relation to the world and as a 
protective helmet.**


This psychological split is the price we have paid since ancient 
times to enjoy the benefits of being a member of society.



Who Came First: Me or I?

'**Me' came first. As children, we express "me" long before we 
learn to say "I." This mirrors our evolution: the emotional 
brain developed before the rational neocortex. Similarly, 
attention precedes consciousness—animals are attentive but not 
self-aware in the human sense.**


In times of acute stress, it is the outer person that falters 
first. Higher functions like planning deteriorate under stress, 
exposing the primal inner me. Evolution has prioritized me’s 
reactive instincts over I’s reflection. In breakdowns, 'I' 
collapses, and me persists. 'Me' can survive without 'I', but 
not the reverse.




'I' and 'Me' in Constant Conflict**

*
"Nobody, as long as he moves about the chaotic**
currents of life, is without trouble."*

C.G. Jung

The inner person is full of varied 
ancient sensations and emotions, which often push 'I' into rigid 
conclusions based on survival instincts.




The outer person, in contrast, has the gift of reflection, 
allowing reconsideration after the fact. This ability to 
strategize and apologize tempers the inner person’s more 
primitive systems. The outer 'I' constantly evaluates and 
controls the inner person’s impulses.



Being human is a balance between bio-operating systems. The 
outer person reflects, strategizes, and gives us the capacity to 
plan, but this comes at the cost of time. Instinctual responses 
from the inner system are faster and often more critical in 
immediate survival scenarios.



Both systems are necessary, and neither can function in 
isolation.



Who Holds the Power?

**At first glance, the outer person seems in control, 
suppressing the instinctual reactions of the inner person. 
Social norms help us override our emotions. However, this 
control is superficial. In reality, the emotional, instinctual 
me holds fundamental power. The outer rational brain exists to 
serve the survival of the primal systems.**


I Know 'Me', But 'Me' Does Not Know 'I'**

*
Of What is significant in one's own existence one is hardly 
aware,**
and it certainly should not bother the other fellow. What does a

fish know about the water in which he swims all his life?

*

Albert Einstein

In its simplest form, 'me' is like 
an attentive animal, reacting instinctively but unaware of 
identity. 'I', however, is self-aware and can verbalize me’s 
emotions. 'I' tells the story of 'me', interpreting its 
reactions.



Despite this, 'me' remains unaware of 'I'. The inner me doesn’t 
need words or reason; it simply reacts. Without language, 'I' 
wouldn’t exist in its current form.



In practice, 'I' often interprets me’s reactions, creating 
narratives to explain emotions. However, the body, closely 
aligned with 'me', responds to physical sensations—touch, 
warmth—better than words ever could.



'I' lives in the realm of language and reason, constantly aware 
of itself and 'me'. Yet much of 'me' remains in a state of 
wordless sensation. As Einstein noted: "What does a fish know 
about the water in which he swims all his life?"



THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIETY AND THE ROLE OF THE MASK**

*There's a bluebird in my heart that want to get out, 
**
but I am too tough for him. I say, stay in there,

I'm not going to let anybody see you.
*Charles Bukowski

Society interfaces with our bio-operating systems. The outer 
'I' is crucial for navigating social life, shaped to perform 
self-control and interaction. The "mask" we wear manages how we 
present ourselves to protect the fragile inner me.



The Civilized Masquerade

**Every advanced civilization creates and depends on a 
masquerade. Since ancient times, we have worn the outer mask of 
self-control. In the theaters of ancient Greece, actors 
performed with masks. These masks were called "personas," a word 
from which we derive the term "person."**


The Ironic 'I'

**The outer person manages social interactions, often through 
projecting a polished version of ourselves. Irony and humor are 
key tools in this social navigation, demonstrating mastery of 
these interactions.**


Outer persons not only control themselves but also engage in 
complex social "games" aimed at managing each other’s inner 
persons. The late-modern outer human has donned a verbal armor 
of irony for this purpose.



The Outer Person's Irony Hinders Spontaneous Spiritual Growth**

*"Then turn to great and serious objects that make you feel 
small and helpless.**
Search out the deeper level of things to which irony never 
descends."

*— Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet

The outer person becomes especially active in groups, taking on 
a performative role. In such settings, we protect ourselves by 
playing ourselves rather than being ourselves. Often, this 
protection manifests through irony, used to conceal the 
vulnerability of inner presence.



In social gatherings, ironic behavior frequently serves to wage 
subtle, hierarchical power struggles, masked by polite, almost 
invisible insults. This small, daily demonstration of personal 
dominance forms the first defense in verbal duels, fought in the 
borderlands between seriousness and humor. This type of irony is 
cynical, reflected in its narrative that it's all "just 
friendly."



The fast-paced, humorous, and ironic exchanges are common in 
workplaces or casual social settings, like when friends gather 
for a drink. Here, individuals duel with seemingly harmless 
wordplay, as the group or its leader instinctively picks a 
target. The target is expected to show strength by laughing 
along, maintaining self-control. It's all just fun and games, 
after all. Yet, these interactions always have winners and 
losers. The "loser" is tasked with shielding their inner self 
behind a persona, hiding any small emotional wound. Their only 
recourse is to return a clever, cutting remark that catches the 
original "winner" off guard.



In this group dynamic, the collective laughter over the target's 
perceived foolishness offers temporary relief from each member's 
own inner turmoil. As the laughter fades, so does this fleeting 
sense of camaraderie. Meanwhile, the one who initiated the jabs 
feels a momentary sense of control, an ephemeral pleasure in 
being on top.



This borrowed sense of power compensates for a lack of inner 
flow. In the long run, the victor in this cynical, ironic social 
interaction is always the outer person. The loser is the inner 
self.



It may seem as if I’m indulging in an overly sentimental defense 
of the fragile inner child. In most other contexts, this 
critique might seem trivial, but not when the goal is to 
cultivate a strong, meditative group dynamic. The ironic mode of 
interaction is simply incompatible with the meditative process.



Irony and Meta-Awareness

**Irony, in itself, isn’t necessarily a negative thing. It can 
be a tool for fostering meta-awareness. A good friend, with a 
well-timed, ironic remark, can make you see yourself from an 
outside perspective.**


Thus, the issue is not irony itself but the intention behind it.



This form of irony that cultivates meta-awareness works best in 
one-on-one interactions. In larger group dynamics, there is 
often a lowest common denominator, and it's rare that irony will 
be used with the right motivations in such settings.

** 
**
In modern society, individuals must control their inner selves. 
The outer person has developed an elaborate "armor" to keep 
vulnerabilities hidden. This mask is not just for survival but 
also a performance aligning with societal expectations.



Cultures create pressures that shape the outer person. The outer 
self becomes adept at managing the inner me, often suppressing 
emotions deep into the subconscious. Today, the mask is not just 
external but part of how we think and feel.



However, the more we develop the outer 'I' for society, the more 
distant we become from the inner me. This can lead to feelings 
of inauthenticity or burnout, especially in high-stress 
environments.

When the Outer Person Takes 
Over

**There is often a complementary relationship between the 
inner and outer person, where many people today invest nearly 
all their energy in developing a compensatory outer persona. The 
primary function of the outer person in this context is to 
conceal the vulnerability of the inner self.**


Leaders, highly ambitious individuals, and perfectionists 
frequently invest most of their energy in the outer person, 
intending to compensate for the inner self’s unruly sense of 
lostness—a feeling that only deepens as the outer person gains 
more control. The more dominance the outer persona exerts over 
the inner, the less capable one becomes of feeling connected to 
oneself, of sensing the untamed, chaotic life within the body’s 
dark interior.



Stress and the Erosion of the Outer Person

**The more society emphasizes control and productivity, the 
more fragile the outer person becomes under stress. Chronic 
stress strips away the outer 'I', revealing the primal me 
beneath. As higher functions deteriorate, the emotional, 
instinctual me takes over.**


In this process, the polished self cracks, and society’s masks 
begin to fail. We are left with raw emotions and primal 
instincts. The more the outer person is forced to control, the 
more fragile it becomes. In the end, the inner me proves more 
resilient in facing life’s challenges.






MEDITATION AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN ME' AND 'I'**

"The privilege 
of a lifetime is to become who you truly are."**
C.G.Jung

In meditation, we focus not on controlling thoughts or emotions 
but on being present with them—just as they are, in their purest 
form. The paradox is that while only 'I' can be aware of me, true 
insight arises from simply observing, rather than trying to 
understand or control. As Meister Eckhart said, "In unknowing 
knowing shall we know God." Through stillness and attention, we 
allow 'me' to surface, unfiltered by language or cognition.



Meditation, then, is primarily directed toward 'me'. It seeks to 
bring attention to the body’s inner depths, where the primal, 
instinctual 'me' resides. In this space, 'me' is free to express 
itself, to sense, to be. The outer I simply watches, cultivating 
awareness without interference. And in this process, 'me' can 
finally be seen and felt.



The irony is that I is the only part of us that can be aware of 
this process. I cannot "create" meditation, but it can 
facilitate the conditions in which meditation naturally arises. 
In the same way that grass grows without effort, meditation 
happens when we stop trying to control it. It is in letting 
go—of effort, of understanding, of the need for outcomes—that 
the deep, wordless flow of me comes alive.

The Foolish Inner Self

**The emotional well-being and potential growth of the inner 
person are crucial to our overall quality of life. However, the 
inner person itself is far from ideal. It is often childish, 
animalistic, selfish, and biased. For this reason, the slower, 
more reflective "I" has often locked away this unruly side of 
ourselves, sometimes so deeply that we aren't even aware of its 
existence. Releasing the inner person into the world requires 
courage, as doing so may unravel the life we know.**


The issue is that imprisonment does not rehabilitate; instead, 
it breeds more disorder. Suppressive and disciplinary thoughts, 
no matter how wise, struggle to change the inner, animalistic 
"me" because the inner self does not understand words. It 
responds to touch but not language. Therefore, the wise and 
rational part of us delivers sermons to deaf ears.



ONLY THE INNER 
PERSON CAN MEDITATE



**Meditation in Vulnerable Strength

*"Rip 
off your mask!**
Your face is glorious."

*—Rumi

•

*"Appear as you are,

be as you appear."

*—Rumi



•



*"A human has many layers of skin covering the depths of its 
heart.

Humanity knows many things; it does not know itself.

Yes, thirty or forty skins or hides, like those of an ox or a 
bear,

thick and tough, cover the soul.

Go into your own ground and learn to know yourself there."

*—Meister Eckhart

I often 
hear from people who have started meditating that their practice 
no longer really works—they find themselves bored or distracted 
by thoughts. They ask for more instruction and techniques.



It is our 'I' that demands techniques and fixed meditative 
routines. The 'I' is a vital part of our ego's ability to plan 
mental strategies that allow us to act rationally. This survival 
and protective system is useful for putting bread on the table 
but functions poorly as an engine for meditation.



That’s why I repeat my life experience like a mantra on 
meditation.dk:

'I' cannot meditate... but 'I' can allow myself to be meditated."



Meditation is a spontaneous and uncontrollable process where the 
'I' 
surrenders by mindfully doing nothing.



In surrender, there is no space for understanding or will-based 
action.

The more 'I' tries to understand and control meditation, the 
"drier" and less inspired it becomes.



You cannot create a meditative flow through understanding and 
will.

You cannot "bodybuild" consciousness.



However, what stands in the way of meditation is deeply affected 
by understanding and will.

My intellect’s task is to realize that it fundamentally cannot 
understand meditation, and therefore, cannot create or control 
the process.



Next, my task is to understand what hinders meditation rather 
than figuring out how to meditate. For instance, 'I' can analyze 
and identify the life situations where meditation does not occur 
naturally.



For anyone drawn to a life of meditation, it’s always important 
to ask: Am I in the right work situation? Am I surrounded by 
people who are in flow themselves? This kind of analytical 
self-awareness is often a necessary broom, a life GPS, enabling 
us to identify all the situations where we are likely not in 
flow and far from the inner river that can carry us to the sea.



Now the question is: If I cannot figure out how to meditate, 
then who is the one meditating?

Where 
Buddha pointed to the moon, it is now time to point to the moon 
as it is reflected in the emotional sea within the inner body. 
In this context, meditation refers to the process in which pure 
awareness spontaneously scans the inner body, gradually 
dissolving emotional wounds and blockages. Feel to heal. 
Wellness here is a byproduct, not the ultimate goal of life in 
meditation.



Meditation 
as a Bio-Feedback Process


Self-referential feedback arises only in sensitivity. As
[mentioned on Meditation.dk](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness), a crucial yet overlooked aspect of 
the meditative phenomenon is the self-referential feedback that 
emerges when sensitive awareness turns inward, much like a 
microphone coming too close to a speaker.



The foundation for effortless meditation is created through this 
introverted bio-feedback, which only the sensitivity of the 
sensory "microphone" can generate.



This is where our new nervous system has its greatest strength: 
sensitivity itself is the key. It’s a new key, designed to open 
a door we haven’t yet seen.



The keys of the past cannot open the doors of the future.



Meditation is a form of neurofeedback, where heightened 
awareness leads to an automatic, self-reinforcing bio-feedback 
loop as described in the chapter,
[The Ouroboros 
Consciousness](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness). In this context I will concentrate on this 
feed back as a process happening between the inner and outer 
self.

**The duality 
of self is here tied to both biological evolution, 'me' and 'I', 
and social constructs. **

The Meditating Animal

**"Me," the inner person, is partly a little animal residing in 
the sensed space of the body. Only when 'I' am fully in contact 
with this "me," and willingly let it take control, does 
meditation happen spontaneously. In this sense, both sex and meditation are 
rooted in animalistic desire. The inner person can only be in meditation 
when the flow to do so is driven by pleasure. Immediate 
gratification—pleasure and play in a broader sense—provides the 
best motivation for the inner "me." However, pleasure requires 
me to let go of control. Just as someone using technique during 
sex moves away from their natural instinct, no one can 
"technique" their way to meditative bliss.**


The reason I have remained in meditation year after year is that 
it feels good for the little monkey inside me—not because I 
planned it as a way to become a better person.



Meditation is both as easy and as difficult as love. Just as we 
can never master love, meditation eludes those who chase it.



If meditation does not passionately meditate you, then you're 
simply wasting your time by trying. It's better to wait for the 
inspiration, much like a surfer waiting for the right wave.



When the right wave comes, and you are awake and aware enough to 
see and feel it approaching, you can joyfully ride it in a flow 
of awareness—a wordless sensation flowing through the inner 
body. If you want anything other than what this moment is giving 
you, you will immediately be thrown off the wave. It is this 
flowing feeling that gives life its meaning, because in the 
instant it arises, all questions disappear.



The meaning of life is not found in a golden pot at the end of a 
rainbow of thoughts. The inner meditative flow is much closer to 
an artistic act, where the artist is the artwork. We are 
meditated like a dancer in free movement. This flow-dancer lives 
in and through mindful silence. He never repeats himself but 
cultivates life’s ever-fresh answers in all their unpredictable 
and unruly forms.


The Inner Person within the 
Outer Person**

**
Ripples in the water from 'me' to 'I' to 'you'.

*"When I saw you I fell in love, 
and you smiled because you knew"

*—William Shakespeare


*"Never wear a mask... To be authentic means to be true to 
oneself. It is a very, very dangerous phenomenon; only rare 
people can do that. But whenever people do it, they achieve. 
They achieve such beauty, such grace, such contentment that you 
cannot imagine. Be true to yourself ... to be oneself ... moment 
to moment... Never wear a mask."

*—Osho

What awaits the inner person as 
the prison doors open?



This feedback loop requires a sensitivity that reaches out to 
the very edges of our nerves, where sensitivity turns into 
vulnerability. Without this, your "microphone of awareness" 
cannot go into meditative self-resonance.



Spontaneous self-resonance in meditative flow existentially 
requires you to be as honest as possible with yourself. Even the 
smallest inner lies prevent you from sensing yourself enough to 
allow the feedback between your "I" and "me" to reach that point 
of no return, where you are meditated rather than meditating. 
Stress does exactly the same thing. 
The purpose of self-deception is to protect you from pain, but 
without confronting that pain, you cannot enter into inner 
resonance. Meditation is not about cultivating pain, nor is it 
about chasing positive thinking. It’s about simply, wordlessly 
revealing and being in what is.



This is one of the central realizations here on Meditation.dk:



Only those who dare to be honest with themselves in utmost 
sensitivity can be 
meditated. This honesty is happening in the space between 'me' 
and 'I'.



The greatest gift we can give another person is pure, wakeful, 
thought-free attention. Now, offer that same gift of attention 
to yourself. Why does the inner person understand attention? 
Because it can feel** attention. The inner person feels. 
Its self-referential system consists of attention. The sense of 
touch is our most significant and crucial organ, not only 
responsible for sensing through the skin but more importantly, 
for registering the incredible variety of nameless sensations 
within the inner body.



Without this awareness, the inner person would be in poor 
condition. In pure awareness, there’s nothing to understand—only 
space for feelings, for the inner person is, above all, a bundle 
of emotions.



In a life cultivated by meditation, you gradually bypass the 
overheated thought-operating system. What replaces it? A new, 
intuitive, hyper-awake, and almost non-cognitive system. In this 
hyper-aware state, you can live happily with 90% fewer thoughts. 
Here, we are not just aware; we are aware that we are aware.



We need two wings for our flight into the skies. One is a bodily 
felt awareness. The other is hyper-awake, thought-free 
consciousness.



The vision is to bring the inner person into the light of 
consciousness and the warmth of wakeful, narrative-free 
attention so that it can grow wise like a tree in a fairytale. 
Slowly, this hyper-aware, inward-focused attention causes the 
inner and outer persons to stop fighting and start merging into 
a coherent being. This takes time... a long time... for Rome 
wasn’t built in a day. This fusion is created by the 
micro-actions of our lives. We are composed of micro-moments. 
Every time you remember—not only during meditation but 
throughout the day—turn your attention inward with an innocent 
"aha." Every time we consciously sense ourselves in wordless 
awareness, we create a small micro-change in the right 
direction.



Thus, even a single second of thought-free inner awareness is a 
victory.



The ideal here is to be able to say about oneself: "I rest in 
myself. I am at home in myself."



I live in an apartment... Me lives in my body... The body is 
me’s home.

Meditation creates a happy me who feels at home in the body.



The intimate sensed connection between "I" and "me" not only 
constitutes our relationship with ourselves but also with the 
world. When I rest in myself, this relationship ripples out to 
our close relationships and surroundings. The more I love me, 
the more I can embrace the entire world.



I recognize myself with sympathy in what I meet and see.



The inner person can only be meditated by stepping into the 
daylight. This allows the soul to breathe out through the cracks 
of the outer person.



Meditation is self-love.


Let us end with a quote from Sylvia Plath:

*"I took a deep breath and 
listened to the old brag of my heart:

I am, I am, I am."*

With glow and flow -
