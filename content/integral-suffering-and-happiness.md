INTEGRAL 
SUFFERING AND HAPPINESS

*The Inner Warrior's Sacred 
Wound***



*I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own,**
without moving to hide it or fade it or fix it.

*Oriah Mountain Dreamer



*"What gives light must endure burning."

*Victor Frankl



*The cure for pain... is pain.

*Rumi




"If you can Face it - God can Fix it

If you can Feel it - God can Heal it"

This chapter 
is about suffering. However, my impulse to write is driven by my happiness. 
It is arriving like a 
circadian rhythm of joyful ease every morning triggered by my 
first and only cup of coffee. When I was younger, I wasn't 
particularly happy. The inner 
happiness gradually crept in through meditation and the 
self-knowledge that emerged from my life long dedicated pursuit of 
'innerstanding.' So I am here to testify that happiness—though 
as elusive as a butterfly in nature—can indeed land in the body.



Already, I find myself in another contradiction. On one hand, 
I here state that I 'own' what I write about in the sense that I 
only write from personal experience. I only talk what I live and 
I live much more than I can express. In 
crafting this discourse and everything elso on Meditation.dk, I adhere to a principle of personal 
authenticity: As far as possible I only share insights and experiences that are 
intrinsic to my own life. This commitment ensures that my words 
on happiness stem from genuine personal fulfillment, 
distinguishing this text from purely academic endeavors or the 
narratives of individuals like Alan Watts for example. Watts, while 
articulate in discussing meditation and spirituality, led a life 
marked by personal decisions that contrasted sharply with the 
wisdom he espoused—evidenced by his departure from his wife and 
kid's and his premature demise due to alcoholism.



At 
the same time, it is obvious that this happiness is not 'mine'. 
I was for some years a tour guide in India. That does not mean 
that I own Taj Mahal. By nature, happiness cannot belong to 
anyone other than everyone. It grows by being shared, but 
actually, we do not even have to entertain the notion of 
sharing. Being in happiness is enough because happiness like all 
other mental states is infectious by nature. However, some ego's 
seems to have develloped a strong immune defence against it and 
hence they feel unease and even occasionally display agression 
when disturbed by too much happiness.




The Cosmic Fool and the Suffering Scribe

**Happiness, I believe, is our natural state. This view may 
seem contradictory to the conclusions drawn by many 
intellectuals and philosophers throughout history. In some sense 
they are right: striving to be happy can often lead to the 
opposite. However, I 'think' 
there's an inherent systemic burden for thinkers: the price of 
insight often comes with a sense of alienation. It could also be 
the other way around, in the sense that alienation creates a 
space for insight. I interpret the quote below from Meister 
Eckhart in this spirit. As I always do, I allow myself to 
understand the Meister's notion of God as equivalent to the most 
mysterious 'no-thing' in us: consciousness.




"Had I a God 
whom I could understand,**
I would no longer consider him God."





"The more we can impute to Him (God) not-likeness,

the nearer do we get to
understanding Him."



Here comes 
then the third contradiction: Why 
do I write as I do - with so many words and concepts? I think 
this urge to verbalize was a gift given to me by the suffering I 
went through as a younger man. The 
intellect was trying to find a way out of the maze of unease and 
confusion, 
and it indeed contributed to that crusade. In this sense I 'own' 
both suffering and happiness.



*The 
lover's warmth, the penetrating depth of his voice,

the appeal of his words - all stem from the pain in his heart.

*Hazrat Inayat Khan



Use the Intellect to Remove 
Barriers

**I must clarify here, just as intellect can never fully 
comprehend the 'soul,' that I don't have the ability to 'create' 
happiness.
The 
intellectual ego's search for happiness is like chasing the famous pot of gold at the end of 
the rainbow. 



Happiness isn't an 
achievement akin to building muscle through weight lifting. 
Rather, it's a byproduct of 'something' that exist beyond our 
direct understanding and control. That mysterious something is 
embedded wthin the realm of [
consciousness](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia).



Therefore 
what I can share are my observations of psychological and 
societal barriers that prevent happiness from taking the center 
stage in our lives. These barriers are within our cognitive 
understanding and our power to overcome by de-constructing them. 
Listen here to what Rumi has to say:




Your task is 
not to seek for love, **
but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself

that you have built against it.

Rumi



Happiness - even in Suffering

**I previosly stated that I 'own' both suffering and 
happiness.**
**Of all the wonderful things I realized on this life long 
journey of 'innerstanding', the maybe most important take away is that that happiness 
and suffering are not mutually exclusive. **


Indeed, it is feasible to find happiness amidst suffering. In 
fact, this form of happiness might be the only kind that can be 
sustained as a continuous state of being. Let me here add some wise words from the Meister.



*A life of rest and peace in God is good;

a life of pain in patience is still better;

but to have peace in a life of pain is best of all.

*Meister Eckhart



From personal experience, I can 
affirm that every step we take on this never-ending journey of 
an accepted, troublesome life simultaneously creates a plateau 
where deeper and higher states of peace and happiness can be 
found. In this dynamic, the depth of our happiness is shaped by 
our suffering. That is why I coined this little koan:



The deeper you 
fly

The higher you fall



However, as this text unfolds, it will become clear that not all 
suffering is beneficial. The kind of suffering that cannot 
coexist with, or contribute to, the depth of happiness is the 
suffering we refuse to accept as a gift.




AUTHENTIC 
FEELINGS AND INTEGRAL 
SUFFERING IN HAPPINESS

**Before delving deeper into the phenomenon of suffering, we 
must first address an essential question: Is there truly such a 
thing as genuine, authentic feelings? This inquiry is closely 
tied to
[the question of individuality](/civilization/inner-and-outer-person#IS_THERE_ANYTHING_AUTHENTIC_IN_ME_). 
If our sense of individuality is an illusion—a mere trick of the 
mind—then it logically follows that our suffering must also be 
illusory.**



Is there something authentic within us?

**Do we possess a deeper, truer individual essence or 'soul'? 
Despite the sophisticated arguments many academics—and even some 
spiritualists—might present, claiming that individuality is an 
illusion, I am inclined to take a stand. While achieving 100% 
authenticity may indeed be a pipe dream, I believe we can move 
closer to a version of inner truth. In this sense, it gives 
meaning to talk about indivduality.**


Here, I am inspired by
[Kantian 
terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself). It is a bit like chasing the horizon—fully 
aware that we can never completely reach it (the 
*"Thing-in-itself"*), yet striving to approach it as closely as 
possible from our subjective vantage point (the *"thing for us"*). 
Our individuality, in this sense, is the *"thing for us"*. For us, 
it is real.



And what, then, is real in this subjective sense? Here, we must 
part ways with Kant's more neutral perspective. Inner reality is 
where the heart resides. Whatever [
love gazes upon becomes real](/love/the-glue-of-love) - *for us.*



But why, then, is it so difficult to experience this inner 
individual essence? It is because, first and foremost, love must gaze 
upon suffering. Suffering is the portal.

**
**

Legitimate Suffering**
**
Late in his life, C.G. Jung made this profound statement:



*"The basis for all mental illness

is created in the avoidance of legitimate suffering."*



What does Jung mean by *
legitimate suffering*? As I understand it, it refers to the 
suffering that arises naturally from life's inevitable 
adversities—a bittersweet blend of joy and sorrow. Jung further 
observed:



*"Nobody, as long as he moves about 


the chaotic currents of life,

is without trouble."*



Jung’s 
insights illuminate a fundamental truth about the human 
condition: the essence of our being, or our soul, is not 
revealed without enduring pain. This leads to an important 
distinction—what Jung terms legitimate suffering, which can be 
understood as existential pain, the primordial discomfort that 
arises directly from engaging with the raw, chaotic realities of 
life.



As an integral part of our survival instincts, we are naturally 
inclined to avoid pain at all costs. However, this avoidance 
carries a price. When we engage in a one-dimensional pursuit of 
positive emotions, I propose that the flourishing of the inner 
human soul is stifled by excessive indulgence. Such fixation 
risks leaving no space for the existential discomfort essential 
for authentic personal growth.



C.G. Jung’s concept of individuation closely mirrors this 
journey. In a state of constant emotional one-sidedness, where 
the pendulum of well-being is forced to swing exclusively toward 
artificial brightness—or its neglected opposite—the necessary 
duality of darkness and light is lost. Yet, it is precisely this 
blend of opposites that lends depth, substance, and richness to 
our lives.




Meditation is Legitimate Suffering

**The Danish poet Otto Gelsted speaks in the poem below, *The Common*, about 
what he calls clean pain. Allowing it to hurt, in Gelsted's 
wonderful poem, is a prerequisite for health and further: the 
possibility of finding the common great find.



***The Common

**All alone, just myself**
I'm happy anyway



Let it just hurt!

Clean pain, it's healthy!



Lie still like a stone,

become hard and become one -

....



Just go down into loneliness,

maybe you will come - who knows -



through the loneliness portal

out to something free and great,



and the common great find!

lay on the loneliness bottom


*Otto Gelsted - 1920



Meditation 
is the attentive, passive, and as far as possible, storyless act 
of resting in the suffering that naturally arises along life’s 
journey. It is in this existential state that the soul attains a 
holographic depth—something it cannot achieve solely through 
positive experiences.



I am fairly certain that Otto Gelsted never read Rumi or other 
mystical texts from the East. As a committed socialist of his 
time, he likely disapproved of religious matters. Yet, 
paradoxically, this detachment lends his insight in* "The Common"* a 
rare purity.



Nevertheless, Gelsted's words tap into a universal human 
experience—one echoed timelessly and spacelessly by the mystical 
brotherhood of humanity, a kinship unbound by knowledge of one 
another yet profoundly interconnected:



*"Accept the pain allotted to you and you will discover in pain a 
joy which pleasure cannot yield, for the simple reason that 
acceptance of pain takes you much deeper than pleasure does.... 
Acceptance of pain, non-resistance, courage, and endurance open 
deep and perennial sources of real happiness."*

Nisargadatta 
Maharaj



*Sorrow prepares you for joy. It violently sweeps everything out 
of your house, so that new joy can find space to enter. It 
shakes the yellow leaves from the bough of your heart, so that 
fresh, green leaves can grow in their place. It pulls up the 
rotten roots, so that new roots hidden beneath have room to 
grow. Whatever sorrow shakes from your heart, far better things 
will take their place. *Rumi



*I said what about my heart

God said: Tell me what you hold inside it

I said pain and sorrow

He said: Stay with it.

*Rumi




Story-told Pain is not Legitimate Pain

**Let me here assert that I am not talking about the pain we artificially inflict on 
ourselves through thought-spin, where we weave ourselves into 
endless stories of self-pity, but only the sensed pain that 
naturally arises in front of our noses on life's not always 
nicely paved roads.**


What is, IS!



The suffering created by our worried and constantly planning 
ego-mind is thus not 'legitimate'.
Legitimate emotions are in this sense the emotions and survival 
thoughts that arise in 
the first split second in the present, when we openly meet the 
world. Meditation is to rest and spontaneously and powerfully 
act in and upon these fresh emotions rather than being thrown back and 
forth like a ball in the ping pong machine of thoughts 
reenforced by thoughts in a 
disembodied state of victimhood. Note 
here that if you fully embrace the first fresh emotion, there 
will subsequently not be so many thoughts to create an extended 
drama out of the situation.

*

*In this exploration, I delve into the nature of what I term 
'fresh emotions.' Fundamentally, our cognitive processes were 
honed as a survival mechanism, a response crafted by the 
amygdala to navigate through perceived threats and discomforts. 
Thoughts, in this context, act as emergency responders rushing 
to the scene of an accident. Their objective is clear and 
necessary: to manage and rectify the crisis at hand, a function 
they have proficiently performed since the inception of our 
amygdala. The issue arises not from their initial response, but 
when these cognitive processes begin to conjure hypothetical 
disasters, trapping us in a loop of imagined crises that our 
primordial emotional body struggles to distinguish from actual 
threats. This blurring of lines between real and imagined 
dangers triggers a cyclical escalation of thoughts and emotions, 
a vortex that invariably spirals downward, retraumatizing the 
psyche.



The intricate and often downward spiralled dance between thought and emotion, while 
evolutionarily advantageous for our mammalian ancestors, beckons 
us now to transcend the biological constructs that have been our 
survival scaffolds for millennia. The longer we dwell within 
these thought spirals, the further we stray from resolution, and 
the more we entrench ourselves in destructive patterns. The 
freshness of our emotional response becomes diluted, 
contaminated by the "ifs, buts, and whens" that clutter our 
mental space.



The challenge lies not in the act of thinking itself but 
in the clutter of incessant, often unproductive chatter that we 
superimpose upon our foundational cognitive layer. This 
acknowledgment is not a call for the abandonment of thought but 
an invitation to sift through the mental noise, to return to the 
immediacy and purity of our initial emotional responses. In 
doing so, we pave the way for a more harmonious integration of 
thought and feeling, where each serves its purpose without 
encumbering the other.



It's crucial to acknowledge the value of a reflective 
mind. There can be a tremendeous benefit in translating our 
inner emotional state into fresh words. However, there is a hair 
fine balance to be obtained in this process. If these first 
thoughts entertain into a spiral where thoughts begin to paint 
feeling patterns on the body-canvas and then new thought try to 
solve these new scenarios, then we have entered the vicious 
circle of retraumatization. That is why Meister Eckhart emphazises 
peace in the pain. As long as there is peace in the pain, 
natural healing occours spontaneously.



To be able to feel oneself uncompromisingly and almost storylessly 
acceptant in all life 
situations creates spontaneous meditation... One becomes 
meditated in and by one's acceptance of oneself and others, an acceptance 
that connects the inner and outer person in emotional dialogue. 
In this sense, one could call Meditation sensed self-honesty, an 
inner emotional honesty, where the one who is oneself 
effortlessly becomes meditated by and in oneself. Does this 
sound hairy? What I mean to say is that spontaneous meditation 
can only happen in self-honesty.



The Projected Purgatory**



**THE WOUND OF PRESENCE

**The incredible miracle here is that the divine mystery touches and 
penetrates me precisely [where I am most vulnerable, traumatized](/adversity/trauma-and-transcendence), 
and complicated.



*The wound 
is the place where the Light enters you **
*Rumi



To contain oneself is tantamount to exposing the inner person in 
the outer. This makes it possible for the soul, our felt 
essence, to breathe through the cracks in the armor of the outer 
person. To be emotionally honest, first with oneself, then with 
others, is tantamount to vulnerability.



The [inner person thus exposes itself in the outer](/civilization/inner-and-outer-person) in what one 
might call a wound of presence.



*When inward tenderness finds the secret hurt,

pain itself will crack the rock and Ah!

Let the soul emerge.

*-Rumi-



To expose this wound of presence in the fresh air is the highest 
form of courage. This form of passive sensing requires courage 
and patience because our biological nature has programmed us to 
think and then act ourselves out of uncomfortable situations.



The great Whole or God or whatever you want to call the 
unfathomable mystery touches me precisely where I am most hurt. 
I have spent an 
inordinate amount of my life on such scenes to reap the precious 
experiences that only mistakes and suffering could give.



To keep that wound open requires a lot of courage and above all 
honesty. We have first of all to be as honest to ourselves. This 
honesty cannot be learned on universities obtaining all kinds of 
degrees. It is all about our character. Most important is the 
nobility of our character.



The Inner Warrior's Sacred Wound

**A shamanic archetype is the wounded healer. On the 
contemporary scene of healers, therapist and psychologist most 
are helpless helpers. A few of these helpless helpers evolve 
into being true wounded healers. **


The one who 
passively can contain his inner interoceptive body is for me a spiritual 
warrior. For this inner wounded warrior, performing outer strength is 
the highest degree of cowardice. The spiritual warrior passively 
contains his own inner war with a smile, while in his inner 
exploration he treads new behavioral paths in the network of 
neurons.



In meeting the wound, it is important not to depersonalize 
oneself. This is the Eastern meditation survival strategy: that 
in case of a painful and catastrophic situation one lets go of 
one's humanity and becomes pure spirit.



We are so often told not to take ourselves too seriously, that 
it is narcissistic to circle around our own little sore navel.
I will say the opposite: take everything in the world personally 
to the highest degree!
Especially take your inner wound seriously. The more secret your 
wound is, the more important it is to expose it - for the wound 
itself is the opening into the inner side of life. In this way 
one could say, that The more secret your wound is the more 
sacred it can become.



However, at 
the same time: ignore your wound in the sense of endless 
story-telling. Instead just be in a state of *'awaring aha'.
*



Just like sleep and meditative wakefulness, the fool and the 
wise man are only separated by a hair's breadth, so taking 
oneself emotionally seriously is close to self-importance. The 
difference lies in the very sensing. The narcissist looks at 
himself from a distance, alienated, while story-telling himself. 
Meditative self-celebration, on the other hand, is created in 
almost thought-free 
meditative wakefulness.



Here's my proposal for the most important of all meditations:

Every second, from now and for the rest of your life, whenever 
you remember, return to the innocent close sensing of the body's 
inner space. Remember yourself in the form of your sensed body. 
The mystic Gurdjieff called this act "constant self 
remembrance." I would term this with the word 'awarance.



The Rasputin Method

**What happens if you take this approach? I dare to claim that 
you will develop true psychic immunity to life's minor 
negativities. This is the foundation of genuinely accessing a 
state where you don’t give a fuck.



Rasputin famously 
immunized himself against poison by deliberately ingesting small 
amounts of the toxins his enemies later tried to use against 
him. Similarly, by confronting your inner wounds—rather than 
ignoring them or weaving them into contrived, New Age narratives 
of fake positivity—you can build genuine life resilience. The Sufis 
understood this secret well, as beautifully expressed by Rumi:




"If you desire 
healing,**
let yourself fall ill

let yourself fall ill."



True immunity 
arises from the "sickness" caused by exposure, not avoidance. 
This process fosters a deep strength, almost on a cellular 
level, that cannot emerge as long as we shield our vulnerable 
core with protective stories in the form of self-deluding 
narratives we tell ourselves to avoid discomfort. To grow, this 
core must be exposed, challenged, and even "infected" by life 
itself.



The Good Mother's Attention

**To allow meditation into the wound of presence requires taking 
full responsibility for even the smallest and perhaps most 
ridiculous or unreasonable vulnerabilities. Nothing is too 
insignificant or small, for the devil is always in the detail.**


Let me repeat the lesson: Let's not meditate ourselves away 
here.

Instead, allow everything, even the smallest sensed things, to 
enter the warming center of attention. Give it the greatest gift 
you can give to both yourself and the world: simple, 
undifferentiated, and non-cognitive attention.



It's like being the good mother. When her child cries, she picks 
it up and gives it attention by cudlling it. She doesn't first ask why the 
child is crying. Nor does she judge it. She just picks it up and 
nurses it with her attention.



By doing the same with your often unreasonable inner children, 
you allow even the most sensitive aspects of your nervous system 
to become a serving part of of the greater architechture in the 
form of you. Cuddle your inner child. It is 
still there - believe me!



To time out and 
feel yourself as a raw, sensed body is not easy. For our 
biological software is outdated and actually more programmed for 
a life in the Stone Age, where all sensations are divided into 
survival-friendly or survival-hostile. Therefore, our dear Rumi must remind us again and again how important it is 
not to run away:



*"Don't run away from grief, oh soul

Look for the remedy inside the pain.

Because the rose came from the thorn

and the ruby came from a stone."

*Rumi



THE HEALING DISCOMFORT**



"If you can face it - God can fix it.**
If you can feel it - God can heal it."



*"Think of 
suffering as being washed."

*Hafez



Beyond the existential necessity of resting in the body's sensed 
duality, there is another, more practical reason to take the 
bull of life's pain by the horns.

I will now reveal a secret hidden in the self-evident: that both 
the body and mind can actually heal themselves through pain and 
discomfort.



For the one who seeks out the pain is not pursued by it.



How do I know this? I know it from my own experience. The best 
way to validate my claim is through your own personal 
experiences in your own inner body laboratory.



When I call it a secret, it's because this innate ability for 
self-healing is so simple and so close to us that we often 
overlook or underestimate its wonderful possibilities.



Many years ago, I read in a scientific magazine that some French 
researchers had observed the amount of white blood cells in a 
finger with an infection. According to them the number of white 
blood cells fighting the infection increased when the test 
person was keeping his attention on the finger through looking 
at it and feeling it from inside at the same time.



W****here 
the Attention Goes, the Life-Energy Flows

**Self-healing, both psychological and physical depends on the 
quality and intensity of our attention. The more our [supreme awareness](/ouroboros/embodiment-of-ouroboros) 
is intensified in meditation, the greater the ability for 
self-healing, when this attention is brought into the body's 
sensory universe. A tired attention is not of much use. **


Attention is anchored in the sense of sensing and feeling. We notice our 
feelings. The sense of feeling is the most important of our 
close senses. This wonderful sense has a double job. It 
functions as the body's last line of defence. It is the 'body community's border guard' in the form of 
the skin's outward sensations and also has an inward task, 
patrolling the almost hidden universe of the inner body.



One of 
the most important sections on Meditation.dk is devoted to an 
investigation of the hidden world of attention.
Meditative healing requires that attention make direct contact 
with the wound of presence, to allow full and innocently 
wordless attention to feel bodily discomfort without fleeing.



Attention understood as the process of ignorant awarance must be cleansed of understanding 
and then in its pure a-ha innocence get close contact with the sensations in the body. The 
wound of presence must not be understood but felt. Any attempt 
at understanding creates a kind of filter where words, concepts, 
and narratives lay like a film between attention and the 
attended. When understanding has clamped the pure sensation, we 
will, for example, in our constant inner monologue tell 
ourselves that we feel sorrow and are sad. The next thing will 
be a bigger story where the inner self tells itself that it is a 
pity for me. Crying is therefore often, but not always, an 
expression of being stuck in a narrative and not having met the 
sensations of the body unadulterated by words. As long as one 
self-narrates one's feelings, one will be stuck in the mire.




Meditation is to go deeper than words and tears.



To accept discomfort and psychological pain in the body is a 
prerequisite for our simple non-analytical attention to make 
direct contact with feelings as pure sensations, that is, before 
they are interpreted by the mind as discomfort or pain. To feel 
your inner body without words allows nature to take care of the 
rest: If you can feel it - God can heal it.

To notice suffering without doing anything about it



*I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own,

without moving to hide it or fade it or fix it.

*Oriah Mountain Dreamer



To feel suffering, as the 
wonderful new age shaman in the above quote says, 
without doing anything about it, without removing it, moving it, 
or hiding it, goes against everything we have learned and 
instinctively feel. In the same way as animals, we try to avoid 
pain.



Let us abandon the older survival systems we created to 
survive

**Ideas of wellness and that it is spiritual to practice positive 
thinking are rooted in the ancient biological struggle for 
survival, where we divide the world into what promotes our 
survival and what does not. First we divide the world into evil 
and good, and then we do something about the evil and try to 
achieve the good. In this context, thoughts are nothing more 
than survival strategies. This polarization of the world is like 
the axis mundi in our old ego-operating system, an obstacle to a 
radical upgrade of consciousness into the state I call the 
super-awake state.**


For the new fluid operating system of awarance to be installed, 
it is above all important to do nothing. By doing nothing, by 
not acting out of life's numerous traps, by not following 
self-development courses, yes, by not understanding, by not 
clinging to the comfort of religions, there is a good chance 
that the old self-system will collapse, and only in this 
collapse can the new consciousness' dancing star be born.



"Stop everything...

Then you will realize you are the freedom

you have always been searching for."



Or maybe even 
better: Realize your inner freedom that was always hiding in the 
wast darkness of the inner dark cathedral of your body, and then 
everything will stop.



The Art of Non-Doing in 'Awarance'

**My warm advocacy for 
non-doing arises from our ego-reality's overemphasis on 
recognizing and acting our way out of uncomfortable situations.**


However, turning non-doing into a new truth would be equally 
erroneous. As soon as we accept something as true, in this 
context, it becomes untrue.



This era's pursuit of an ostensibly perfect and perpetually 
happy existence leads, paradoxically, to a profound 
superficiality. By narrating away our primordial pain, we not 
only distance ourselves from the immediate experience of that 
pain but also from the very essence of our soul. The act of 
fleeing from the discomfort inherent in life's challenges 
through stories and narratives serves to distance us further 
from the authentic self, creating a barrier to true 
understanding and acceptance of the human experience. It is easy 
to see how one can flee from pain by being artificially social 
media happy. However, on can also flee from legitimate pain by 
identifying as a victim.



What is the soul? For me, the soul is the living hologram of 
simple beauty that appears when human consciousness coherently 
observes and senses the world's incomprehensible interference 
patterns with a light akin to laser light. The more synced our 
consciousness becomes, the more synced the world around us will 
be.



For our consciousness to achieve sufficient coherence to find or 
rather be the multi-dimensional answer to the contradictions that have 
no solution on the four-dimensional space-time plane they were created and formulated 
in, suffering and darkness must be the equal partner of light 
and joy. Meditation therefore starts and ends in the simple 
thing that we day in and day out make ourselves as good friends 
with negative emotions as we are with positive emotions.



Meditation is *amor fati *of pain

**How can I now be sure that life is perfect and not unfair to me? 
In my case, I must say that I was not able to intellectually see 
through whether the world's total sum of dynamic infinite 
interaction in its flow through me was evil or good.**
Therefore, I chose to see it as perfect - or rather perfectly 
imperfect.




Yes.. everything is chosen so well and every time I lose, I win 
a bodily life experience and thus a precious depth in my soul, 
which people who have not suffered are not so lucky to get. With 
this choice, most of my suffering disappeared; namely the 
suffering all my thoughts about what should have been different 
had caused. Resting in natural life pain is for me the very 
foundation of a healthy life in meditation. Meditation is in 
this sense the *
[amor fati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati)
*of pain.




Without darkness in life, spiritual development is not possible. 
In this sense, pain and discomfort are our best friends - for 
unlike joy, which puts us to sleep, suffering keeps us awake if 
we are able to be with it.



As the yin yang symbol, happiness always have a dot of sorrow in 
it and suffering always a smile.




IGNORE 
YOURSELF IN FULL AWARENESS

**The first step on the ladder of inner happiness is 
navigating a path that meanders between the poles of emotion and 
reason, between surrender and control. Take, for example the 
combination of winter bathing, sauna sessions, and breathing 
exercises. This down to earth practice, popularized by the Dutch 
'Iceman' Wim Hof, has blossomed into a broad spectrum of 
self-disciplinary techniques encompassing yoga and meditation.
**



I've carved out my own approach to these self-disciplinary 
routines and so can you if you like to do so. The important 
thing here is to fully experience 
one's emotions while simultaneously detaching from them, 
ensuring they don't dictate one's actions. How does one remain 
in command when engulfed by intense emotions under keen 
awareness?




What can we learn from such a simple act as a cold shower? Here 
we definitely feel and sense our body while a the same time not 
listening to and obeying old instinctual habits. Not listening 
to old unconscious impulses is the first step towards not 
listening to the story telling mind.




*Take no Notize - *But in Full Awareness!*

***The key lies in abstaining from weaving narratives around our 
feelings. This has to be repeated as a mantra: Instead ignore them in full awareness of their 
precense. One could call it a state of ignorance in awareness.




The Zen-buddhist have a saying:* Take no notize.* We humans, fundamentally bound to storytelling, often narrate 
our lives, especially our emotional experiences. Yet, in the 
practice I've cultivated, I advocate for a departure from 
narrating our feelings. Instead, I propose 
a process where emotions are observed in their raw 
form, devoid of attached stories. In this practice, feelings are 
broken down into [manageable 'pixels' of sensation](/fields/meditative-pixelation), inviting us 
to experience and contain them in full-blown awareness. In the 
pixel- state, feelings and sensations are so decomposed that the 
thinking mind cannot brew stories out of them, but awarenes on 
the other hand is fully capable of awaring them.

This approach 
encourages ignoring emotions not through dismissal but through 
full, undivided attention, allowing us to politely resist and 
control them while being fully present with the sensations 
metaphorically perceived as 'energy.'



For further understanding, the chapter, "[meditative 
pixellation](/ouroboros/embodiment-of-ouroboros#MEDITATIVE_PIXELLATION_OF_THE_INTEROCEPTIVE_REALM_)" 
delves deeper into actual techniques, offering personal insights 
into the transformative 
potential of cultivating interoceptive awareness with patience and kindness 
but also a bit of self-discipline.
