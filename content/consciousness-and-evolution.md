Consciousnes and Evolution




**























CONSCIOUSNESS AND 
EVOLUTION**




*'**Our unique attributes evolved 
over a period of roughly 6 million years. They represent 
modifications of great ape attributes that are roughly 10 
million years old, primate attributes that are roughly 55 
million years old, mammalian attributes that are roughly 245 
million years old, vertebrate attributes that are roughly 600 
million years old, and attributes of nucleated cells that are 
perhaps 1,500 million years old. **
If you think it is 
unnecessary to go that far back in the tree of life to 
understand our own attributes, consider the humbling fact that 
we share with nematodes [roundworms] the same gene that controls 
appetite. At most, our unique attributes are like an addition 
onto a vast multiroom mansion. It is sheer hubris to think that 
we can ignore all but the newest room.*'

David Sloan Wilson - *
Evolution for Everyone*, 2007


(Wilson's timeline is by now outdated. However,


this has no importance in this context.)

Reflecting on Wilson’s 
observations prompts us to reconsider not just our evolutionary 
past, but also our everyday experiences in a more profound and 
contemplative light. As the title of Wilson's book implies, 
these evolutionary observations are not novel. The same holds 
true for this text. The aim here is not to present 
groundbreaking scientific research but to revisit familiar concepts in a 
contemplative and illuminating manner. Next time you casually 
declare, *'I am hungry,*' pause and consider how mystical, 
ancient, and unchanged this impulse truly is. Such reflections 
foster humility and awareness. They reveal how sensations like 
hunger, arising from deep within—become mundane when appropriated 
by the ego. Behind ordinary statements such as *"I am hungry" *
lies a sensational world brimming with wonder. Beneath our 
conceptual understanding of hunger, roundworms insistently communicate in their primordial language.



Indeed, this profound truth permeates every thought and 
sensation we experience. Behind the veil of conceptual 
simplifications, roundworms and countless other ancient whispers 
continue speaking to us, reminding us that the infinite mystery 
of life continuously awaits our exploration. To truly perceive 
this, we must consciously revisit the familiar and simply pause to observe deeply 
in novel ways.




*'What is this life if, full of 
care,

We have no time to stand and stare?-




No time to stand beneath the boughs

And stare as long as sheep or cows:



No time to see, when woods we pass,

Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass:



No time to see, in broad daylight,

Streams full of stars, like skies at night:



No time to turn at Beauty's glance,

And watch her feet, how they can dance:



No time to wait till her mouth can

Enrich that smile her eyes began?



A poor life this if, full of care,

We have no time to stand and stare.'

*Leisure (1911) - W.H. Davies




The Recipe for a Human****
What is it actually to be a human being seen from a biological perspective? What 
bitches brew does it take to make such an impossible creature? Here's my take 
on the recipe:




Take about 40 liters of water. Add 
the right amount of Precambrian primordial sea salt. Fine-tune 
it to match the exact percentage of salt in that ancient sea. 
Then, add two kilograms of various bacteria. These bacteria, 
among them mitochondria, lived freely or in symbiosis before 
they became peaceful bio-citizens in the human body. Include 
countless forms of viruses, even some inherited from 
Neanderthals. Now, blend in cellular life forms that stretch 
back to the dawn of life. Finally, sprinkle about one percent of 
actual human genes over our 'Frankensteinian' brew.



This recipe is too long to complete here, but all ingredients 
lead to one conclusion: anatomically, humans are a baroque 
composite, a synthesis of untimely prehistoric beings.



In this sense, the human body is a living zoological museum, 
composed of life forms and behaviors that reach back to the 
earliest stardust.



This odyssey was made possible by cooperation and recycling.





OUR RECYCLED BIOLOGICAL 
STRUCTURES**




*'**We still draw the boundaries of our 
personality too narrowly. **
We always count as part of our 
personality only what we separate as individual, recognize as 
deviating. But we consist of the whole mass

of the world, each 
of us, and just as our body itself carries the

development 
pedigree down to fish and even further back,

so we have in the human soul everything that has ever lived.'

*Hermann Hesse: 
*'Demian'*





We are composed of reused bio-software. From an evolutionary 
perspective, humans are made of various survival systems. The 
oldest code in this recycling process is of course our 'urge' to survive. 
It’s the teleological reason we are still here. All functional 
Darwinian systems, from the primordial soup onward, are 
preserved as building blocks in our biological and psychological 
architecture.



**Evolution doesn’t anihilate its foundation. Instead, it 
builds on existing biological structures. Our bodies are the sum 
total of all our previous species' lives.**



As humans, we've only been here for a 
brief 2.5 million years. As zoological cell colonies, we are 
much older. Inside us are all forms of life’s previous 
forms, cells, microbiomes, worms, reptiles, and mammalian 
systems, coexisting under one roof. Some lie dormant; others help 
us in the game of survival.



Ion channels in Necturus salamander cells are found in rats and 
humans. Any DNA that worked well in evolution is reused by more 
advanced systems. The genes that regulate our heartbeat 
originated in sea anemones. We share 25% of our protein-coding 
genes with trees. Our appetite is driven by genes developed in 
roundworms. Our teeth started as odontodes, dermal denticles 
that preceded both fish schells and teeth. Our face was formed when we 
were still fish. A fish face has eyes, a mouth, and sometimes, 
like the blobfish, even a nose!

The Blob fish - Psychrolutes marcidus*




In the fetal stage, we relive our 
species' history, developing the beginnings of gills, for 
example.








As seen in this 
[BBC 
video](https://youtu.be/wFY_KPFS3LA?si=qALGpVG1kBxbDe1n), a human fetus’ face is formed between the second and 
third month, assembled like a puzzle. This starts at the fish 
stage, finally forming a recognizable human face. The final 
piece is the *philtrum*, the groove under the nose.



Notice how the face, just before it takes on a human form, goes 
through various zoological stages in the shape of animal faces. 
During the fetal stage, we climb up all the previous steps on 
the evolutionary ladder that our species has utilized.



Before taking on a human form, our face passes through various 
zoological stages. During fetal development, we climb the 
evolutionary ladder, revisiting every step our species has 
taken.



*'Unzeitgemäßheit' - Untimeliness


***Using Ernst Bloch's term 
"unzeitgemäßheit" (untimeliness), albeit out of its original 
context, we can see that our bodies are complex amalgamations 
of biological systems developed throughout life's vast history. 
The past continues to influence the present; we exist in 
multiple timelines concurrently. We are echoes of the primordial seas, bearing information from 
every epoch. As a result, various parts of our anatomy differ in 
age. While some body parts operate on ancient bio-software, 
others utilize newer systems. Only the latest brain functions 
operate in full consciousness, with older systems rooted in 
primal, more dormant states of awareness. Most of our existence 
unfolds in unconsciousness. That is not just due to Freudian 
repression, but because our body, a patchwork of genetic 
software, dates back to our earliest origins as single-celled 
entities in ancient seas. In 
summary, the human cell colony is a Noah's Ark for all previous 
life's bio-operating systems.




Let repeat this simple yet profound fact: as biological 
beings, we live at the intersection of prehistoric animals' 
operating [systems streching 
from](#NOTE:EXAMPLES OF REUSE) biomechal history to neurological functions. We are a 
living untimely zoological museum, a hub where even ancient reptiles 
behaviors have 
survived the passage of time. **




We are a patchwork quilt of mostly ancient elements, with only 
small traces of the modern, each layer adding complexity to what 
we call 'human.' In fact, the majority of what makes us is not 
even human.






THE BRAIN'S TRIUNE DISAGREEMENT**




*'We are obliged to look at 
ourselves and the world through the eyes of**
three different mentalities, two of which lack the power of 
speech.'*

MacLean




The illustration below shows the 
brain as constructed in three layers. This is, of course, a 
strong simplification of the actual conditions. It may 
[even be 
incorrect.](https://medicine.yale.edu/news/yale-medicine-magazine/article/a-theory-abandoned-but-still-compelling/) Nonetheless, it is thought-provoking. The project 
here is not strict empirical brain science, but to intuitively 
view the brain's different operating systems as deposits from 
various time periods in our evolutionary history.





![](/images/triunebrain.jpg)




The innermost and oldest part of 
the brain, the basal ganglia, or R-complex, is shared with reptiles. 
It governs our most instinctive and autonomously regulated 
behaviors. These primal mechanisms operate to a large deegree independently 
on their own terms and are 
unable to comprehend the emotions of the mammalian brain or the 
language of the human neocortex.




The middle layer, the limbic system, is common to mammals. It 
allows us to sense ourselves and the world with emotional 
awareness.



At the top lies the neocortex, shared with whales and great 
apes. This outermost layer is the seat of language, abstract 
thinking, and consciousness. Of particular interest are the 
frontal lobes, where human self-awareness maybe resides.



The idea that our brain is layered, reptilian at the core, 
mammalian in the middle, and human on the surface, offers a 
striking lens through which to understand impulsive acts like 
Uruguayan footballer Suárez’s sudden bite of an opponent. After 
all, a soccer match can be seen as a symbolic tribal battle over 
a prized resource, not unlike animals fighting over food. We 
battle ourselves as we battle others, and we unite in groups 
only to face other groups in new forms of struggle.




UNTIMELY SYSTEMIC CONFLICTS AND 
COOPERATIONS

**From brain circuits to individual psyches to entire 
societies, it becomes evident how difficult it is for different 
survival systems, each evolved in its own time—to cooperate 
harmoniously. The ego, in this context, can be seen as a 
mediator: a survival structure asserting itself as the leader of 
the pack of confused personalitites and assisted by words and 
concepts saying, *''I' did this'* or *''I' chose to do 
that'*. As Meister Eckhart observes:




'The tendency 
is ever towards self-repetition, towards the preservation of the 
species: it is every man's intention that his work should be 
himself.'




Fragmented by nature, the 
ego-centric system seeks affirmation by opposing others. And 
when no external 'other' is available, it turns inward, fighting 
itself in a recursive loop of identity defense.**


It is every Systems's Intention that it's work should be 
Itself

**Conflict and cooperation coexist at every level, both within and 
between systems. According to Niklas Luhmann’s systems theory, 
society is composed of functionally differentiated systems, each 
governed by its own code and logic. These systems are 
self-referential. They communicate internally, but rarely 
coordinate seamlessly across domains. This disjunction breeds 
friction, miscommunication, and systemic conflict.**


Take, for example, the divide between government and economy: 
one operates on the logic of power, the other on profit. 
Governments aim to regulate for the public good, while 
businesses lobby for deregulation to maximize gain—resulting in 
mutual misunderstanding. In healthcare, doctors aim to heal, but 
insurance companies focus on cost and risk, often denying 
treatments despite medical necessity. Law upholds legality; 
education aims for qualification. These aims may conflict when 
legal structures constrain pedagogical freedom. Science pursues 
truth; politics pursues power. Scientific evidence is often 
disregarded when it becomes politically inconvenient. And while 
the judiciary seeks justice, media seek attention, creating 
distortions when sensationalism overrides due process.



Luhmann describes these systems as structurally coupled but 
operationally closed: they depend on one another but interpret 
reality only through their own lens. Deep cooperation, in this 
view, is not impossible but inherently limited.



MATHEMATICAL REUSE

*Structural Reality, Not Just Poetic 
Analogy

*
**When we apply these insights to the structure of our 
untimely brain, striking parallels arise that reach beyond 
metaphor. As emphasized on Meditation.dk, existence appears 
intricately patterned by mathematical principles that recur 
across all scales—from the infinitesimal to the cosmic. When the 
iris of a human eye mirrors the structure of a galaxy, it is not 
merely symbolic. It reflects fractal, algorithmic reuse. As 
above, so below.**


Seen in this light, the frictions we experience, between brain 
regions, between individuals, and across societal systems, are symptoms of layered, asynchronous 
architectures striving to coexist. Whether biological, 
psychological, or institutional, these systems were not designed 
for seamless integration but for survival in separate 
evolutionary contexts. Yet what emerges is a deeper pattern: the 
recursive reuse of form, logic, and structure across domains and 
scales. What may seem like disorder begins to reveal itself as a 
perfectly imperfect choreography of tension and balance, an 
algorithmic dance inscribed into the fabric of life, culture, 
and consciousness.



Societies and cultures reflect this same recursive rhythm. Our 
collective memory, embodied in myths, rituals, and narratives—is 
a continuous negotiation between the ancient and the new. Human 
storytelling circles back to archetypes, the hero’s journey, the 
sacred transformation—not because we lack imagination, but 
because these patterns are deeply rooted in our cognitive and 
social architecture. They are not endlessly reinvented; they are 
endlessly reinterpreted.



How far beyond metaphor does this fractal repetition extend? I 
do not claim to know. I only wish to point out that these 
recurring patterns might not always be poetic coincidence. 
Sometimes, similarity signals structure.



THE REFURBISHING OF UNTIMELY RECYCLED SYSTEMS****
Since the [days of 
the Silk Routes](/civilization/civilization-and-consciousness), travelers gathered in caravanserais to 
share stories around the campfire. Embedded in these tales was carried insights, values, and 
questions that shifted as the stories journeyed through time and 
space. A compelling example is Ludvig Holberg’s '[*Jeppe 
of the Hill*](/civilization/civilization-and-consciousness#Holbergs_Jeppe_on_the_Mountain)', which illustrates how narratives adapt and 
evolve across cultures and epochs.



The story’s roots trace back to an Indian parable exploring the 
concept of maya - illusion - posing the timeless question: is a 
beggar dreaming he’s a king, or a king dreaming he’s a beggar? 
In early European retellings, this metaphysical theme fades, 
replaced by reflections on class and social order. Holberg’s 
version further transforms the narrative into a cautionary tale 
about role-swapping, highlighting a commoner’s inadequacy in 
imitating nobility.



As stories travel, their core messages are reshaped, reflecting 
the values and anxieties of each culture they pass through.




Survival of the Fittest System Through Repurposing

**Much like dormant genetic codes activated for new functions, 
our social systems repurpose old survival strategies, reframing 
them to serve modern needs. Like biological evolution, our technologies build upon what 
came before. The internet arose from telecommunication systems, 
which evolved from postal networks. Smartphones are compact 
computers built on decades-old principles. Evolution, both 
cultural and biological, is recursive, cumulative, and 
conservative in structure. But it also is a retrocausal 
transformer of its own past. This goes so deep, that we cannot 
even recall a memory
[
without changing it](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2012/09/your-memory-is-like-the-telephone-game/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). **



This brings us back to the untimely 
architecture of our brain.
To balance internal conflict between brain regions evolved in 
different eras, evolution didn’t simply stack new parts atop old 
ones. It also renovated those older structures. Like restoring a 
centuries-old house, evolution reinforced the basement rather 
than demolishing it. The damp cellar, the reptilian 
brain, remains, but now with upgraded wiring from the neocortex.



That is why the notion of the triune brain is much more complex 
than understood in the
[days of 
McLean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain). The old systems, both above 
and below, will always get refurbished by the new ones.




In this light of fractal repetition, urban civilization reflects 
its biological retrocausality. 
Cities still contain buildings from a century ago, with roads 
designed for cars invented decades back. But now, everything is 
layered with digitalization, just as the human brain’s newest 
layers send neural projections into its oldest parts. We live in 
ancient body-homes, old walls, pipes, and frameworks, but they’re 
fitted with central heating, smart lighting, internet, and 
modern insulation.



Thus, the biological reuse of old systems, retrofitted for 
modern needs, is not only a principle of evolution but an 
algorithmic reality, pervading every level of life. In summary 
systems, reshape each other
**in their dialectical dance between conflict and cooperation.**



EXAMPLES OF BIOLOGICAL REFURBISHING

**Below I will walk through some examples of how older 
survival systems like Holberg's theatre play Jeppe on the Hill 
has got entirely new meanings. The emphasis here is that these 
repurposed, older layers never function exactly as they did in 
their heyday.**



Goosebumps as Positive Emotional Markers

**Take for 
the phenomenon of hairs standing on end. In our evolutionary 
past, this response was associated with aggression or fear. In a similar vein to hairs 
standing on end, the phenomenon of goosebumps was originally an 
evolutionary response to cold or fear. The rising of small 
'pimples' on the skin would have helped our hairy ancestors 
retain a layer of warm air close to the skin or it would have 
helped them to look bigger and more dangerous. Nowadays, we often 
experience goosebumps during emotional or awe-inspiring moments, 
such as listening to a beautiful piece of music.




Furthermore in mystical 
traditions, many recount experiencing this same biological 
reaction during profound encounters with the divine. I've had 
numerous experiences myself where all my hairs stood up as I 
felt a transcendent presence fill my soul. In this way, a 
biological mechanism originally intended to signal threat has 
been repurposed to signify intense, positive emotions.





**Morphed Organ Functions

**Lungs and Swim Bladders: In fish, the swim bladder is used 
for buoyancy. It is thought to have evolved from the lungs of 
ancestral fish that adapted to life underwater. In this way, an 
organ used for gas exchange in one environment was repurposed 
for buoyancy control in another.**



In Public Speaking** **
The 'fight or flight' response is a primal reaction geared to 
prepare our body for imminent threats. Yet, in today's world, 
non-life-threatening scenarios such as public speaking or job 
interviews can spur this adrenaline and cortisol surge. Interestingly, actors 
and public performers often attest that a measured dose of this 
age-old adrenaline can enhance the vigor and caliber of a 
performance.




Blushing and Social Interaction****
Blushing is thought to have 
evolved as a social mechanism to show submission or a change in 
social status, helping to establish social hierarchies without 
the need for violence. Today, it serves as an involuntary 
emotional signal, revealing feelings like embarrassment or 
romantic interest, which can carry different contextual 
meanings.




Pupil Dilation as a Sign of Interest****
Pupil dilation originally 
served the purpose of allowing more light into the eye in 
low-light conditions. However, it's also been observed to occur 
during states of emotional arousal or when looking at someone we 
find attractive, giving a new social context to an old 
biological function.



Tears as Emotional Signals****
Crying is thought to have initially evolved as a way to clean 
and lubricate the eyes. Now, tears have a communicative 
function, signaling
[
feelings](/civilization/inner-and-outer-person#emotions versus feelings) like 
sadness, joy, or relief, and prompting social support or action 
from others.




Smiles &
Laughter for Social Bonding** **
Laughter likely had its origins in 
signaling contentment or trust within a social group. While it 
still serves this function, it has been co-opted for various 
purposes in complex human societies, ranging from a form of 
critique (satire) to a way of strengthening social bonds beyond 
immediate family groups. Similarly, smiling, especially when 
showing teeth, can elevate oxytocin levels in both the smiler 
and the recipient. However, flashing teeth in a smile to a dog 
might be misconstrued as aggression.




These examples demonstrate how biological traits originally 
evolved for one purpose can be repurposed or imbued with new 
meanings in complex human societies.



However, glimpses of the original behaviors these bio-operative 
systems were intende for can often be seen 
through the veneer of modernity. Consider Western political 
tendencies for power struggles and exploitation of other 
cultures. Aren't these just echoes of our ancestral primate drive 
to dominate the food chain? The primal reflexes of our ape 
ancestors are still lurking just beneath our tailored suits. 
When we peer down into an abyss, we feel a sensation in the 
sphincter and coccyx, regions rife with nerves that have 
outlived their original purpose. These nerves remain blissfully 
ignorant that the tail they once helped to balance has long 
since disappeared.

In this context, the layered perspective of the brain retains 
its validity.

PSYCHIC ARCHEOLOGY


*Excavation through Conscious Introspection***




*'There are people who, through 
concentration and other yoga exercises, can bring the 
subconscious up to the conscious level where they can discern 
and judge, and thereby benefit from the unlimited treasures of 
the subconscious memory, among which not only the memory of our 
previous lives is stored but also the past of the lineage, all 
pre-human forms of life, and the memory of the consciousness 
that makes all life in the universe possible.'**
*Lama Anagarika Govinda




The time has arrived to introduce 
an entirely new perspective on this concept of evolutionary 
patchwork. Let me first highlight this point through Hesse's 
profound insight: we are indeed *
['the whole mass of the world.'](#OUR_RECYCLED_BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURES_)*



This realization naturally raises the question of how we might 
consciously engage with this timeless, internal accumulation of 
worldly experience.



Drawing from personal experience, I confidently assert that the 
primal, Precambrian cells within us still vibrate with life's 
fundamental frequency, accessible to those who cultivate enough 
inner silence to perceive it. This is not a solitary 
claim, consider Lama Anagarika Govinda's above observations.




While it may 
initially seem unconventional, meditation can indeed be 
understood as a form of inward archaeology. The following text 
will explore this intriguing idea further. The poem by the Sufi 
mystic Rumi provided below elegantly portrays the journey of 
life as a profound process of spiritual evolution.





*'**Originally, you were clay.

From being mineral, you becamet vegetable.

From vegetable you became animal, and from animal, man.

During these periods man did not know where he was going,

but he was being taken on a long journey nonetheless.



And you have to go through a hundred different worlds yet.

I died from minerality and became vegetable;

And from vegetativeness I died and became animal.

I died from animality and became man.

Then why fear disapearance through death?

Next time I shall die Bringing forth wings and feathers like 
Angels.

After soaring higher than angels-

You cannot imagine.

I shall be that.'*




This 
mystical vision suggests that our personal evolution mirrors 
both the biological and spiritual journey of all life, making 
introspection an excavation not only into our ancient, 
collective past but also into our future.



In fact, this inverted way of viewing material unfoldment as a 
product of spirit is not foreign to Western thought. By the late 
18th century, translations of Sufi mystics, including Rumi, had 
made their way into German philosophy. 


[Schelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling), 
inspired by these mystical insights, repeated Rumi's ideas, 
tracing the journey from unconsciousness to fully awakened 
consciousness, this time not unfolded in the mystic, but in the 
creating artist and his art.




*The universal spirit,

which slumbers in the stone, dreams in the plant,

awakens in the animal, becomes conscious in man

and reaches its highest unfolding in the artist.



*

![](/images/rumi_cosmic.jpg)







Now, the task is not merely to philosophize but, as Lama Govinda 
suggests, to consciously journey inward through these 
archaeological layers of previous life experiences. For this 
exploration, we require an introverted consciousness, 
illuminating our path through the half-awake animals, dreaming 
plants, and slumbering stones still residing within our inner 
darkness. This inward journey simultaneously becomes a journey 
backward through time, making introverted consciousness 
inherently archaeological.



Those who bravely turn inward, away from external distractions, 
discover within themselves experiential realities far surpassing 
the limited capacity of the rational, language-oriented brain. 
At deeper levels, we all resonate with the primal roar of the 
lion and the terrified cry of the deer, evoked by ancestral 
memories encoded within our amygdala and beyond.



We 'innerstand' all life because we consist of recycling

**In meditation, we intuitively 'innerstand' the lion's roar. 
We share fundamental biological operating systems with it. The deeper we explore 
our inner life, the older layers of human evolutionary history are revealed. In 
this sense, meditative introspection mirrors astronomical extrospection: the 
further we gaze into the universe, the older the phenomena we observe.**


The next creature to confront is the snake or dragon, ancient symbols of the 
reptilian brain. This bio-circuit operates beyond the realm of emotions and 
feelings, consisting primarily of abstract patterns of sensing. In ancient 
Indian traditions, it is symbolized by the Kundalini snake, the serpent power 
that energizes the awakening of consciousness. However, the reptilian brain is 
not only accessed through meditation. In dreams and psychedelic journeys, the 
snake frequently reappears.



Just as researchers can recreate a dinosaur snout on a chicken by reversing its 
genetic code, we can, through meditation, revisit our own inner biological 
prehistory in an evolutionary journey. This journey takes us back to what I, 
borrowing from [Meister Eckhart](/western-mystics), 
call the *'ground of origin'*. Here, this ground rests in the billions of years of 
cellular life humming within us. The billions of cells that make up what we call 
a human being are a living, prehistoric cross-section of the entire journey of 
life.




To OWN an Insight Through Experience

**It’s one thing to read about these ideas, but by truly looking and feeling 
within myself, I have experienced myself as part of the biological world mass. 
As a sea anemone, I have sensed the tides of the primordial ocean. I have felt 
the snake crawl up my spine on its journey to the brain. I have lived the inner 
Stone Age man’s impulse to throw the first stone at a man from a foreign tribe. 
Yet, in this, I am not unique. Anyone who turns inward with sincerity can access 
these earlier, not individual, lives, but universal life forms that reside within 
us all.



The majority of this journey must be undertaken without the identity we 
associate with the *'I'*. To turn the inner zoological clock back even for a 
second requires letting go of the familiar sense of self.



**Reincarnation - What is Reincarnating?

**Again and again, reports of reincarnation surface in connection with deep 
meditative experiences, near-death encounters, and entheogenic journeys. These 
experiences are often interpreted as individual because, in our normal state of 
consciousness, we perceive ourselves as separate individuals. Thus, Mr. Petersen 
might feel as though he has experienced being Mr. Hansen in a previous life. But 
this happens when our limited mind takes linguistic ownership of a profound, 
non-verbal experience. The small ego tries to translate something from a 
fundamentally incomprehensible, multi-dimensional universe into our familiar 
world of three dimensions. And it fails. **


What incarnates is not me or you. It is life as a collective phenomenon of 
gene-expression. As such it is a scientific fact.



In this context, the ego is like a frog at the bottom of a well, trying to 
explain the life of birds in the sky. An even more fitting analogy might be ants 
attempting to describe a highway with cars, an experience so vast that their 
attempt to cross the highway is entirely at the mercy of forces beyond their 
comprehension.




Individual versus Transpersonal Life

**At this point, language itself begins to strain under the weight of trying 
to convey experiences that occur beyond the typical subject-object relationships 
in a three-dimensional universe of time, space, and matter, as we know them from 
daily life. In such experiences, there is no 'I' in the conventional sense to 
observe or narrate.**



We consist of collective reincarnated operating systems whose primary task has 
always been survival.
Transpersonal experiences of pre-existence are therefore not personal in 
nature. Individuality and language are relatively recent evolutionary 
developments, appearing within the last few thousand years.






FROM SEA TO LAND





Consider this: Life evolved in the 
oceans for roughly 3.5 billion years before any organisms made their way onto 
land around 375 million years ago. This means over 90% of our evolutionary 
history unfolded in water. We were oceanic beings for more than ten times longer 
than we've been terrestrial. Even now, our bodies reflect this aquatic heritage: 
we are composed of about 60–70% water by weight, and this water carries a 
mineral composition remarkably similar to that of Precambrian seawater. If we 
count individual molecules rather than mass, over 99% of the molecules in our 
bodies are water molecules. In this sense, we are still walking oceansfl, uid 
creatures shaped by ancient tides, carrying within us the deep memory of the 
sea.



In this sense, we carry a distant but massive memory of our aquatic origins, 
projected into myths like Atlantis, while our own inner 
'Aquaman' continues to live within us.

In this ever incarnating and retrocausal memory of our world mass we might 
maybe rather use watery existence as a fitting metaphor. Listen here to Mirabai:




*'Oh Friend! Understand

The body is like the ocean

Rich with hidden treasures.

Open its innermost chamber

and light its lamp.'

*– Mirabai





In the context of 
life's billions of years of evolution, this is less than a blink of an eye 
compared to the birth of cellular life in the primordial ocean. We rose from aquatic Precambrian life, and we still carry it 
within us, protected by cell membranes. We are now washed 
ashore on the coast of life, essentially walking waves stirred 
by storms from the primordial ocean and warmed by sunlight from 
a million mornings.



Swimming in one's own Cambrian primordial ocean is something that can be done 
without the traditional sense of self. Here, you are a traveler of attention and 
consciousness, unbound by the ego-operating system we rely on in everyday life. 
This alone can make the encounter with one’s evolutionary past feel unsettling. 
The sense of control that our everyday consciousness clings to has no place 
here.





Continuing with zoological imagery, this is entirely my 
own poetic way of describing something that is difficult for the 
conscious, cognitive mind to grasp. These metaphors help me 
'innerstand' and connect with my interoceptive sensations, but you might 
find different imagery that resonates more with your 
experiences. What inner creatures might you discover within 
yourself?




Most of the 'civilizations' of 
survival systems accumulated over time within our body are recalibrated versions 
of ancient aquatic bio-operative systems. Even though we at some point in our 
evolutionary journey crawled from the ocean to the land we remain deeply watery 
in nature. Many of these ancient systems, such as the mechanisms driving our 
heartbeat, can trace their origins to creatures like sea anemones, already 
thriving in the pre-Cambrian oceans. Every cell in our body lives a miniature 
aquatic life, rooted in our ancient oceanic origins. The salt content in human 
blood plasma, extracellular fluid, and other bodily fluids is remarkably similar 
in composition to seawater, containing sodium, chloride, and trace amounts of 
other minerals. Even the hardest part of us, our teeth, evolved from the 
protective shells of ancient fish. 





Inner Jellyfish, Fire Coral, and 
Sea Nettles

In the deepest realms of meditation, oceanic metaphors make 
sense for me to describe these three-dimensional energy patterns 
or clusters. The 
shapes and movements of these inner sensations often resemble 
aquatic life. Let me introduce my inner jellyfisha slow-moving 
sensory pattern that drifts around my stomach, with tendrils 
extending into my arms, legs, and head. Depending on the 
intensity of the sensation, it can transform into something more 
like a fire coral or a sea nettle, emitting prickly or burning 
sensations. These jellyfish-like creatures, along with cou, ntless 
other inner life forms, seem to live autonomously, swimming 
through the body’s dark, primordial ocean.



Anyone willing to introspectively explore their inner landscape 
can embark on a hunt for these ancient Cambrian creatures 
lurking namelessly within the body’s inner darkness.




It’s utterly fascinating to realize that we carry within us such 
a varied sensory aquarium without being aware of it. How 
astonishing it is that we can know so much about the external 
world and yet remain profoundly ignorant of our own inner world.



The Inner Zoo: Ancient Life Forms and Land Creatures

**It’s not just primordial aquatic creatures we find within us. Our 
bodies also harbor land creatures, representing different 
evolutionary stages. We all carry snakes, reptiles, mammals, 
prey, and predators within us. As we move up the evolutionary 
ladder, these energy forms become more dynamic and fast-moving.**


The ancient, pre-Cambrian energy forms, like jellyfish, move 
slowly, almost like tidal waves. In contrast, the inner monkey 
leaps rapidly from branch to branch, making it a challenge to 
track and contain. At first glance, one might assume that 
catching a jellyfish would be easier than taming a monkey. 
However, the paradox is that the older the bio-operative systems 
are, the more difficult they are to grasp, and thus harder for 
consciousness to penetrate. Their very slow-moving, continuous 
nature makes them elusive to a mind wired to detect change and 
quick patterns. It is precisely their timeless, unhurried rhythm 
that consciousness struggles to comprehend.



Communicating with the Inner Creatures

**Our conscious a-ha awareness becomes the lingua franca for 
communicating with the ancient, remodified life forms within us. 
The highest act of love is simple, conscious attention. When we 
offer this loving attention to our inner animals—often 
frightened, wounded, or confused, they begin to relax and find 
peace within their own natural rhythms.**


Where should we begin?



In my experience, it is far more important to engage with the 
Cambrian creatures within us than with the more evolved 
reptilian, mammalian, or early human parts. The deeper we go 
into these ancient cellular life forms, the more profound the 
transformation becomes.



If we can transform the jellyfish so that it no longer stings, 
even the restless inner monkey seems to calm down. The 
relaxation of our inner world begins with conscious love and 
attention directed toward the primordial depths of our being. 
From this core of ancient awareness, healing radiates outward to 
all later layers of these zoological energy creatures, gradually 
restoring balance and harmony across the entire inner ecosystem.





Every Organism has its Own Consciousness****
The illiterate mystic Nisargadatta Maharaj claimed that the sole 
purpose of life is to protect, expand, and develop 
consciousness.



For every life form, whether it is autonomous or functions as an 
organ in a larger biological context, there is an internal 
feedback-based operating system organized in some form of 
consciousness. In this sense, every living organism has a companion in the form 
of a conscious operating system. The logical consequence of us being carriers of 
the biological world mass is that we also have all previous forms of conscious systems within us. We not only share 
appetite-regulating mechanisms with roundworms, but we also, on 
a small scale live 
a life through their rudimentary form of consciousness.



These primordial forms of consciousness is what I in the 
chapter, 
[What is 
Awareness](/consciousness/the-mystery-of-awareness), refer to as *
'awareness'. *



Many of these archaic awareness operating systems still 
contribute to our maintenance as a human cell colony. Others are 
rudimentary and/or dormant but can be awakened under special 
circumstances. This is in this light I understand the Indian 
mythology of the Kundalini snake entering the thousand petalled 
lotus of the brain.



Even individual organs of the human body have their own field of 
'awareness', which in turn link up with each other in the same 
way that countries form alliances.



It seems that these awareness fields, in their collective 
connection in hubs, become increasingly conscious. The more 
systemically complex they become, the more 'awake' they become.



It is my clear intuitive feeling that any self-referential 
system becomes aware and thus alive when it reaches a 
certain point of complexity. In this context, it might be irrelevant 
whether it concerns machines or biological life.



THE RETROCAUSAL JOURNEY HOME**


*I am a lizard King - I can do 
everything - *J. Morrison




A consciousness liberation of our inner nerve tree's long 
delicate branches requires that, in our meditation, we address 
sensitivity rather than flee from it. Let us now meditate 
directly into the body and sensitivity to manifest the clarity 
of consciousness that the Eastern traditions' Indian-anchored 
survival strategy meditation forms have invested in life beyond 
the body for good reasons. **


Meditation.dk is 
for those who dare to venture into the darkness of the body. 
Here, the brave explorer 
lights the light of wakefulness. What actually happen when we 
let consciousness travel inward? Imagine consciousness as light, 
but also heat. Light can both be seen and felt. Once this 
warming light shines inward, everything it shines on will start 
to morph in super-intelligent ways beyond the understanding of 
the small cognitive mind.



Consciosness as the Supreme Refurbisher

**Pure consciousness - freed from the narrowing filters of 
cognition - is the ultimate refurbisher of our ancient past. 
Nothing remains unchanged once it has been illuminated by 
awareness. As described in the chapter 
[
Meditative Pixelation](/fields/meditative-pixelation), 
whatever is observed inwardly begins to morph the moment it is 
seen.**


We cannot look back consciously without altering where we came 
from. It is not only memory that changes when 
recalled, everything does. In the metaphor of psychic 
archaeology, the ancient civilization we uncover is recreated from the very first moment of 
excavation.



The word religion stems from the Latin *'religare'*, 
meaning to reconnect—to re-establish a link with something 
ancient and foundational, while simultaneously transforming it 
into something new. That is why I have often stated on this 
site: a copy can be better than the original.



In this sense, I regard meditation as a deeply ‘religious’ 
endeavor—not in the dogmatic sense, but as a conscious journey 
back into the biological, fluid mass of our own being. Unlike 
the unconscious descent we make each night into sleep, this is a 
descent into darkness carried out with the wakeful light of 
consciousness as our lantern.



This inner journey, in my view, is the most important journey a 
person can undertake. It is a return to the rootw, here we 
discover, paradoxically, the roots of the future.



For Freud, this journey stopped when one had reached an 
understanding of childhood.
Jung took a much deeper dive beyond the boundary of our 
individual lives. The ancient yogis explored inner landscapes 
far beyond the intellect.



For the brave meditator, the journey has hardly begun here. For 
it continues back to the beginning of life in the primordial 
sea, a primordial sea that still exists encapsulated in droplet 
form in our cells. Perhaps the journey only ends when we 
recognize o urselves as the stardust our carbon molecules are 
made of.



Yes, meditation is sacred psychic archaeology. Here we, as 
luminous beings, unearth our reborn selves from the sacred ruins 
of forgotten lifetimes.

NOTE ON BIOLOGICAL REUSE:



Biomechanical History****
Consider the structure of the human hand. At first glance, it's 
a uniquely human trait that enables us to grasp tools and 
manipulate our environment. But this too is a biological 
patchwork. The basic 
[pentadactyl limb configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_common_descent) is hundreds 
of millions of years old, shared with many other vertebrates, 
from bats to whales. So, the human hand is not so much a 
revolutionary design as it is a modification of ancient 
blueprints.



Genetic Echoes****
If we move even deeper into the genetic layer, the idea of 'junk 
DNA' also adds to the narrative of biological reuse. Once 
thought to be useless, these stretches of DNA are now known to 
play roles in regulation, development, and disease resistance. 
Some may be remnants of ancient viruses that infected our 
ancestors and became integrated into the genome. Here, the 
evolutionary echo persists even in our genetic code.



Genes for Development - Hox Genes

**[Hox genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hox_gene), which are responsible for body plan development, 
are remarkably conserved across animal species. They control the 
placement of limbs and organs in everything from fruit flies to 
humans. In both cases, the same genes dictate the 
anterior-posterior axis of the creature, showing that the basic 
"blueprint" for laying out a body has been reused and modified 
over hundreds of millions of years.**


Molecular Machinery

**[ATP Synthase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_synthase): This enzyme is responsible for making ATP, the 
energy currency of the cell. It is highly conserved across all 
domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota), indicating 
its fundamental importance. Even in vastly different species and 
cell types, the mechanism for producing ATP is often strikingly 
similar, a clear case of biological reuse at the molecular 
level.**



Sensory Systems

**Opsin Proteins: These light-sensitive proteins are found in 
the photoreceptor cells of the eye and are vital for vision. 
Remarkably, similar opsin proteins also exist in simpler 
organisms. For example, certain algae use a form of opsin to 
sense light direction for photosynthesis. The fundamental 
molecular machinery for detecting light, therefore, appears to 
have been reused for various forms of vision in more complex 
organisms.**


Gut Instinct

**Our gut microbiome is another fascinating area of biological 
reuse. Comprising a complex ecosystem of bacteria, viruses, and 
fungi, our gut microbiota affects everything from digestion to 
mental health. Many of these microbes have ancient origins and 
have co-evolved with us, playing an essential role in our 
survival. These internal communities mirror ancient 
environmental ecosystems, now internalized.**



Behavioral Traits

**Fight-or-Flight Response: This basic survival mechanism is 
shared across a multitude of species, from humans to small 
mammals and even birds. When faced with a threat, adrenaline and 
cortisol levels spike, preparing the organism for rapid action. 
This physiological response has been conserved because of its 
effectiveness in promoting survival.


**The Neurochemical Symphony

**Even our complex emotional lives carry the vestiges of our 
evolutionary history. Neurotransmitters like dopamine, 
serotonin, and oxytocin govern everything from our pursuit of 
rewards to our social bonds. These chemicals are not unique to 
humans; they serve similar functions in many other animals. The 
pathways that produce feelings of happiness in humans can be 
traced back to mechanisms that once helped simpler organisms 
navigate their environments in search of food or mates.
**



Neurological Functions

**Serotonin: This neurotransmitter, crucial in regulating mood 
and emotion in humans, has a long evolutionary history. 
Interestingly, it serves a similar function in invertebrates 
like lobsters, which also use serotonin to modulate social 
status and aggressive behavior. The conservation of serotonin as 
a social behavior-modulating molecule across such diverse taxa 
indicates a form of biological reuse.
