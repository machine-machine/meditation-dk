**Beyond Pixellation: The Medium 
of Inner Space

**After exploring the previous chaters , it’s time to 'look' around—not at the movement of energy itself, but into the very medium in 
which this pixelated flow unfolds. What is the stage on which 
these sensations arise? What is the nature of the dimensionality 
of this inner world—so fundamental that we often overlook it?**


Let me in this context repeat the lessons from the previous chapters 
about consciousness. 
Pure consciousnes in its abysmal essense does not expand, neither in quantity nor 
in 
quality. Consciousness belongs to another dimension where such terms from time 
and space does not give any meaning. What expands in clarity and quality is the 
part of the human brain that somehow is able to recreate a simulacra of of what 
Meister Eckhart terms '*the 
primordial ground*'. 




The Inner Cathedral - A Space Beyond Space

**With eyes closed, immersed in the inner world of energy, we 
find ourselves within a vast, dark expanse—a space that is 
undeniably present yet strangely elusive. I call this space the
*"inner cathedral"* for the profound sense of awe it 
evokes. Like a grand, silent hall, it stretches before us, not 
in any ordinary sense of dimensionality but as something both 
vast and intimate, infinite yet contained within.**


In the enveloping darkness, stars invisible in daylight suddenly 
emerge, uncovering another layer of self-evident obscurity. 
Within the dark cathedral of our inner night, we can newly 
perceive the dormant states of our body.



As often mentioned throughout this work, the greatest marvels 
are often hidden behind the veil of the familiar. The sheer 
obviousness of this inner dark space makes it easy to ignore. We 
can enter it, experience it fully—then forget it the moment 
consciousness swings outward again. It’s astonishing how we 
carry such mysterious vastness within us, yet remain preoccupied 
with trivialities like media and mortgages.



A Space Beyond Space: Duality & Non-Duality in Superposition

**This inner cathedral does not behave like ordinary 
three-dimensional space. It defies the familiar rules of depth, 
distance, and direction. Instead, it feels like a paradox made 
tangible—both vast and intimate, boundless yet contained within 
you.**



Metaphorically, it can be described as a realm where duality and 
non-duality exist in a state of superposition—where form and 
formlessness, movement and stillness, separation and unity merge 
into an experience that slips through the fingers of logical 
understanding. It is a "spaceless space"—a locationless 
location. It is hidden, [ like 
the breath you forget until you notice it](/ouroboros/new-ouroboic-intelligence)—and then it feels 
undeniably present.



This ‘location’ is the home of consciousness—not as a fixed 
point, but as an open field where awareness is aware of itself. 
Imagine an infinite number of mirrors, each folded into the 
other, reflecting endlessly in all directions. Their infinite 
reflections don’t fragment reality; instead, they converge into 
one singular mirror—capable of reflecting everything, including 
itself, from all angles and positions simultaneously.



This is not just a metaphor for perception but a reflection of 
the very nature of consciousness—a phenomenon capable of 
observing not only the world but also itself observing.



In this space, there is no center, yet everything feels 
centered. This magic mirror doesn’t merely reflect images; it 
reflects itself. When we
[
consciously choose](/ouroboros/new-ouroboic-intelligence#THE_CONSCIOUS_CHOISE_) to turn awareness inward, allowing 
consciousness to observe itself, it reveals its own nature 
through an [endless 
feedback loop](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness)—an infinite unfolding where the observer and 
the observed dissolve into one seamless flow of self-knowing.



Here, in this mirror of mirrors, the boundaries between subject 
and object dissolve. You are both the reflection and the one who 
reflects, the seer and the seen.



But rather than accept this as a mere idea, I urge you to test 
this for yourself. After reading this chapter, close your eyes 
and step into your own inner world. Observe how this 'space' 
behaves. Is there depth? Is there shape? Is it "somewhere" at 
all? Notice how the mind tries to grasp it by trying to project 
external space-time coordinates into it, only to find itself 
dissolving into something more fundamental.



This is the medium of our inner reality—the space where 
transformation unfolds. Now, let us explore its nature further.




Tony Woody: Crashing Into Consciousness

**To point out that I am not alone with these fudamental 
strange findings hidden within, I will 
examplfy its unique spatial characteristics based on 
insights from a YouTube video, where former army pilot Tony 
Woody recounts his profound and authentic near-death experience 
during a plane crash:







Tony Woody’s account, though 
rooted in the extremity of a near-death experience, offers a 
rare glimpse into a consciousness unbound by the usual 
constraints of identity and perception. What does this tell us 
about the nature of space within? Perhaps it suggests that the 
boundaries we assume—between self and other, within and 
without—are more porous than we think. This brings us to the 
curious interplay between expanded consciousness and 'reality'.**


Although
[ 
I have commented this video elsewhere](/love/the-super-awake-flow#Tony_Woodys_near-death_experience_) on this site, I would like to 
specifically address his description of an exploding Pepsi can 
in front of him in this context. The description begins at the 
5:00-minute mark. Below is a transcription:


*" ... and moving forward at 150 
plus miles an hour and it had to have gapped the front corner of 
that fire truck that's how close we came to it as it's spinning 
without hitting it and and I just there's a difference between I 
think I'm going to die and I'm dead and I know it there's a big 
difference in that and that's where I was at and so when I was 
out of body about that time he went into reverse thrust and 
because we're on asphalt it's not planes don't normally travel 
on there's a lot of dust and debris out there and somewhere 
from somewhere this pepsi can came up and shot across the 
windshield from left to right it probably took milliseconds 
right but It was slow motion. I'm seeing this thing 
tumble pepsi. I could see pepsi. It's a pepsi can 12 ounces. I 
could see that the fluid coming out of it - brown fluid and 
then it atomized the fluid as it hit the air the wind that was 
hitting it and the turbulence, and I started focusing on the 
little bitty pieces of debris, and then all of a sudden I didn't 
just have my outside perspective and the inside perspective. I 
became the debris. I was where every tiny piece of debris was all 
wrapping and rolling around each other, but I had a 360 degree 
bubble vision view from every one of these millions of 
perspectives at the tiniest piece of debris that was in the air** 
and I'm totally confused if you think it would be chaotic right 
it was a bit confusing because I didn't understand what was 
going on really but it was there was this uh **this sublime 
perfection going on everything was right where it was supposed 
to be doing exactly what it was supposed to be doing exactly 
when it was supposed to be doing it and everything was perfect.
**I 
had that I don't know how I knew that but I felt it it's more 
like a feeling and an understanding and a knowing then but it 
confused me at the same time."* **
- Tony Woody


Tony Woody's description reveals 
an extraordinary shift in perception that transcends the 
boundaries of ordinary experience. His account moves from a 
moment of life-threatening danger into a deeply altered state of 
consciousness that challenges the conventional understanding of 
time, space, and identity. What begins as a hyper-focused 
observation of a tumbling Pepsi can transforms into a profound 
experience of unity, where the distinction between observer and 
observed dissolves entirely.




The moment when he describes becoming the debris is a critical 
turning point. He moves from perceiving the debris to embodying 
it, experiencing reality from the perspective of countless 
particles swirling in the air. This shift suggests a collapse of 
the traditional subject-object dichotomy. The observer is no 
longer separate from what is observed; instead, he becomes part 
of the unfolding moment, experiencing it from multiple 
simultaneous perspectives like mentioned in the mirror-analogy. 
This could be interpreted as an experiential understanding of 
non-duality — a concept found in mystical traditions where the self and the universe are 
understood as one interconnected whole.



Woody’s description of *“360-degree bubble vision” *and the 
ability to perceive from millions of viewpoints simultaneously 
resonates with the idea of expanded consciousness. In this 
state, spatial and temporal boundaries dissolve. He describes a 
paradoxical sense of confusion alongside a profound recognition 
of order: everything was *"right where it was supposed to be, 
doing exactly what it was supposed to be doing, exactly when it 
was supposed to be doing it."* This realization points to a 
deeper, intuitive understanding of reality as inherently 
structured and harmonious, even amidst apparent chaos.



Drawing from Woody's experience, we can explore the notion of 
the “inner cathedral” — a metaphor for the sacred space within 
consciousness where duality and non-duality coexist. In this 
space, the observer and the observed merge, creating a place 
beyond place where awareness expands beyond traditional 
boundaries. Woody's experience of becoming the debris embodies 
this concept. He is simultaneously everywhere and nowhere, 
perceiving reality from countless vantage points while being 
fully immersed in the unfolding moment.



This experience also invites us to consider the fluidity of 
identity. Woody's shift from being an individual observer to 
becoming the debris challenges the fixed notion of self. In this 
expanded state, identity is not confined to a single body or 
perspective but flows through the entirety of the experience. 
The 'self' as consciousness becomes the entire field of perception — an 
interconnected web of particles, each carrying its own viewpoint 
within the collective whole.



From a theoretical perspective, Woody’s account can be seen as 
an experiential manifestation of superposition, a concept from 
quantum physics. In superposition, a particle exists in multiple 
states simultaneously until observed. Similarly, Woody 
experiences reality from countless perspectives at once, 
embodying a multiplicity of viewpoints without being confined to 
a single, fixed identity. 
Like stepping into an infinite mirror, Woody’s experience 
reveals how consciousness can collapse into itself, reflecting 
reality not from one vantage point but from all—mirroring the 
vast, boundaryless cathedral within.

The Morphing Shape of a 
Consciousness that Discovers Itself

**Let us once again turn our conscious attention inward—not 
merely to the sensory phenomena themselves, but to the very 
shape of the vast awareness that holds them. As this inward gaze 
deepens, consciousness begins to reveal a subtle yet profound 
shift: it becomes capable of observing not just its contents, 
but itself—the medium in which all inner experiences arise.**


As explored in the chapter Meditative Pixellation, the conscious 
act of observing sensory patterns, emotions, and feelings 
dissolving into 'pixels' gradually transforms them into 
something more fluid—into energy. But energy for what? This 
energy appears to fuel consciousness itself. Viewed through a 
biological lens, human consciousness feeds on the dynamic flow 
of interoceptive energy within the body, creating a 
self-sustaining feedback loop. As inner energy intensifies, 
conscious awareness expands, and this very expansion, in turn, 
generates more energy, reinforcing the cycle.




The Tibetan spiritual tradition, among others, emphasizes 
dissolving blocks and tensions in the body as a means to expand 
consciousness. The freer the flow of energy—or prana—within the 
inner body, the more fuel there is to awaken and sustain higher 
states of awareness. This, for me, is the esoteric meaning 
behind the ancient Greek saying: *'A healthy soul in a healthy 
body.'* The body is not merely a vessel; it is a dynamic 
energy field that both shapes and is shaped by the quality of 
consciousness it contains.




In this self-amplifying process, consciousness not only 
illuminates the energy patterns within but also gains the 
capacity to perceive the container itself—the context that 
space-holds this energy. The moment consciousness turns its gaze 
toward its own spatial framework, something extraordinary 
happens: the very borders of this inner space begin to shift and 
morph in ways that defy conventional understanding.



This abstract, borderless border of consciousness becomes 
perceptible precisely in the moment of expansion—after all, 
without contrast, the notion of expansion would hold no meaning. 
The spatiality of awareness becomes fluid, capable of expanding, 
contracting, and even inverting upon itself, like a balloon 
stretching beyond its own dimensions, from the infinitely vast 
to the infinitesimally small, and back again.



Here lies a crucial insight: only a space that is consciously 
self-aware—engaged in an [
ouroboic feedback](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness) loop with itself—can undergo 
such a transformation. As Einstein described the universe as an 
entity that curves and folds into itself, so too does 
consciousness when it becomes ‘ripe’ enough. This ripening is 
not merely an intellectual achievement but an existential 
threshold—a moment when awareness recognizes itself as both the 
subject and the space it inhabits.



This ‘evolutionary’ moment, where consciousness turns upon 
itself to become self-conscious, is radical. It breathes new 
life into existence while simultaneously dissolving the 
framework of our old life. It is both a birth and a death—a 
profound metamorphosis that cannot be taken lightly. In this 
sense, it is no child’s play.



Hence, my favorite Meister says:


*'There are all too few who are 
fully ripe for gazing in God's magic mirror.'

*—Meister Eckhart


This magic mirror is nothing other 
than consciousness reflecting upon itself—an infinite feedback 
loop where the seer and the seen, the knower and the known, 
dissolve into a single, boundless conscious awareness.


The Limits of Language: 
Consciousness Beyond Expansion****
I am not a quantum physicist, but I dare to postulate that the 
ouroboic space—unlike the external Newtonian space—is closer 
to a 
quantum space. Consciousness itself is the primordial ground 
where quantum fields of superposition unfold. With this 
intuition fresh in mind, we can return to Tony Woody’s account 
of [the exploding Pepsi can](#from_somewhere_this_pepsi_can), where thousands of Pepsi droplets 
did not merely appear before him—they became him.




This is why vocabulary borrowed from the quantum world feels, at 
least intuitively, more fitting. Terms like superposition, 
entanglement, and non-locality gesture toward realities that 
transcend classical logic, hinting at the elusive, paradoxical 
nature of consciousness. Yet even these concepts—groundbreaking 
as they are—fall short. They are, after all, still rooted in the 
descriptive models of the very universe that consciousness 
upholds.




The crux of this limitation lies in a simple yet profound truth: 
[consciousness is primordial](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia). It is not a phenomenon within the 
universe, but the very ground from which the universe arises. 
Consciousness is eo ipso—self-evident, self-originating, and 
foundational. It precedes the quantum field, the fabric of 
space-time, and any conceptual framework we attempt to impose 
upon it.




Because consciousness is the condition for all perception and 
understanding, it cannot be fully contained within the 
structures it upholds. Trying to describe consciousness from 
within the universe it makes possible is akin to asking a mirror 
to reflect itself without an object before it. The reflection 
requires a medium, yet consciousness is both the medium and the 
reflection—simultaneously the canvas and the painting, the 
silence and the song.



However, as mentioned often on this site, this limitation does not mean we should abandon the 
attempt. On the contrary, the very act of trying brings us 
closer to what 
[Emanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant) referred to as the *Ding an sich*—the
*'thing-in-itself.'* Though we are inevitably confined to 
experiencing reality through the lens of the *'Ding für uns'*—the
*'thing-for-us,'* filtered through perception and 
cognition—there remains an innate drive to reach beyond these 
boundaries. This striving is not futile; it is the evolutionary 
pulse of consciousness itself, folding back to recognize its own 
essence.



Each metaphor, each fragment of language, is like the enigmatic
[
footprints of the Buddha](/consciousness/between-nothing-and-something#The_Enigmatic_Buddhas_Footprints_). Even when words fall short, they point, they hint, 
they gesture toward the ineffable. Perhaps that is their highest 
function—not to capture reality, but to remind us of its 
vastness.



In this spirit, we continue to define consciousness in an 
impossible dance with it. To articulate the inarticulable. To 
stand, however briefly, in awe of the fact that we can even ask 
the question.
