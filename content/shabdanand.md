Shabdanand - The Noblest 
Soul
**






![](/images/Shabdanand5a.jpg)




Meditation is kindness—not the 
superficial kind that originates from the thinking mind, but a profound 
kindness so deep that it triggers a process of dissolving. The guards you 
didn’t even know were protecting you, stationed in an automated state of 
high alert, lay down their weapons of unconscious suspicion. And you begin 
to melt. The blockages of icy resistance cannot withstand the warmth 
emanating from the soft words of a gentle and kind-hearted noble man like 
Shabdanand. 


Shabdanand embodies a kind of kindness I have 
never encountered before. His unusual kindness is rooted in an ever-present 
attentiveness when he listens. Within just ten minutes, you'll feel that you 
are very special, yet at the same time, you may experience a sense of 
disappearing.**


His voice is like a soft, soothing melody, and this voice, full of empathic 
compassion, saved the life of a friend of mine. While I was in India in 
1995, one of my friends back in Denmark was going through very painful 
private events. It was so hard on him that he contemplated suicide. I talked 
with him several times by phone from India, trying to dissuade him from his 
decision, but with no success. When Shabdanand heard about this, he insisted 
on talking to my friend by phone. We went out to the telephone booth outside 
the Be Man Temple. My friend did not know Shabdanand, but that did not 
matter. After an hour of conversation, my friend was completely free from 
any suicidal thoughts. In fact, he was entirely happy again and full of 
optimistic thoughts on how to move forward in life.




Such was the power of Shabdanand's attentive kindness.



It was goodness and happiness—not from the strategic mind, but emanating 
from beyond the very cells of his being. The Indians call it* Sat Chit 
Ananda*. 'Ananda' means bliss. 'Shabd' refers to the word or sound beyond 
the physical. In this sense, Shabdanand was truly Shabd Ananda.

Shabdanand is one of the most 
truly humble and beautiful human beings I have ever met. At 
the age of 79 (in '96), he was
[
running up the staircase like a young man](radha_soami_meditation.htm#The_Curse_of_being_a_Guru_), leaving me 
breathless in my efforts to keep up with him. He has truly 
taken the seven steps to heaven, yet he will still take the 
time to drink a cup of chai and share a smile with you at 
the bottom of the ladder.**


Such taste in that cup of chai!


Shabdanand's 
Mother was a great Saint. And he grew up
and lived under the guidance of her spiritual lineage beginning with the 
mother's guru
Data Dayal.

*Two brothers in spirit - Shabdanand with [Lahori Pandiji](spiritual_master_meditation.htm)*


I often asked Shabdanand to 
share stories from his life. Nothing was better than 
listening to him as we sat on plastic chairs in the ashram 
courtyard at sunset. One day, he recounted a story about his 
mother, whom the Indians refer to as a household saint. 
Despite her demanding daily routine as a married, devout 
Indian woman, she replaced sleep with deep meditation on her 
beloved master’s form, continuing this practice until her 
death in her late nineties.



The Heart Knows

**One morning, when Shabdanand was still a boy, his mother 
emerged disturbed from her meditation room, revealing that 
she had seen her master, Data Dayal, suffering from a severe 
infection in his leg during her meditation. She immediately 
prepared for a 300km train journey to visit Data Dayal, 
taking Shabdanand with her. They arrived late at night at 
Data Dayal’s ashram, where, unusually, Data Dayal was still 
awake. Shabdanand's mother, an expert in medicinal herbs 
within the Ayurvedic system, had brought a basket filled 
with various healing herbs. After prostrating before her 
guru, she declared, *'You have three infectious boils on 
your right leg, Maharaji! Allow me to treat you!'* Data 
Dayal willingly surrendered to his devoted disciple’s 
capable hands and showed her his leg, which indeed had 
exactly three large boils.**


After curing Data Dayal, she returned home where she could 
once again meditate in peace. Curious about her remarkable 
knowledge that transcended physical distance, I asked 
Shabdanand how his mother could have known about Data 
Dayal’s condition. He replied,* 'A loving heart always 
knows. The secret of telepathy and clairvoyance lies in the 
loving heart.'* Intrigued, I then asked what happens when 
one person loves another without reciprocation.* 'Then 
only the loving heart will know, not the other'* he said 
with a smile.



Here is a video recording of my 
very first meeting with Shabdanand:

Teachings of Faqir Baba II






Meditation is living every 
moment as poetry. However, this poetic state can quickly dry 
up, like the skin on old hands. Once, Shabdanand Ji shared 
with me:**


*'Data Dayal told Baba Faqir Chand that his own teachings 
were outdated. They could no longer transmit the truth as 
times had changed. Because of this, he instructed Faqir to 
adapt the teachings to modern times and to his own 
experiences.'

*

What a wonderful statement! Unspoken truth is timeless. But 
as soon as you articulate it, your statements are bound to 
age with time. The greatness of this lineage lay in its 
ability to recognize the time-bound weaknesses of teachings 
as soon as they manifested in time and form.


The 
Crossing

**Shabdanand once shared a 
personal story that illustrated the unfaltering honesty of 
Faqir Baba. As a young man, Shabdanand was attempting to 
cross a delta of dry river beds at the foothills of the 
Himalayas. Suddenly, immense water masses from a heavy 
shower several kilometers away in the mountains rushed into 
the river beds, sweeping him off his feet. In terror and 
fear, he cried out Faqir Baba's name:* 'Help me! Guruji 
save me!!'* Then, miraculously, Faqir Baba appeared in 
the water beside him and dragged Shabdanand to safety.**


A month later, Shabdanand visited Faqir Baba's ashram to 
personally thank him for saving his life. Faqir Baba 
received Shabdanand with great love and affection and 
listened attentively to his story. His reply was profound:* 
'Dear friend, I was not there at the river. I did not save 
you. I know nothing about this incident. In fact, what saved 
you was your own power, created by your strong belief in 
me.'



*This was
[
how honesty taked](faqir_baba_the_meditation_master.htm#Truth revealed0) with the voice of Baba Faqir.

How fortunate we are to know 
that at least a handful of good and super honest human 
beings were and are here with us on this planet. And I can assure 
you, dear reader, their happiness is as contagious as the 
flu during an Indian monsoon. This is, and was, at least my own 
experience in the company of these wonderful people.

Let me end this ode to the most wonderful 
Mr. Wonderful with a little episode I experienced with him. We were 
invited to a family home in Faridabad, but it turned out that the house 
was already full of VIP visitors. Moreover, it was unbearably hot, as it 
was the end of May just before the rainy season. Hence, Shabdanand and I 
decided to sleep under the open sky on the roof of the house. However, 
after some time, a swarm of the most nasty mosquitoes found us. I cannot 
recall ever being so stung as I was that night.**


Shabdanand then said with a sigh and a smile:* 'Dear Gunnar! It is God 
who sent these mosquitoes to us to remind us that this earthly life is 
not our real home'.*
