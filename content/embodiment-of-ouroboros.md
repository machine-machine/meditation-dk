Bodhidharma and 
Ouroboric Super-Consciousness

**Bodhidharma, the sixth-century Indian monk famed for 
bringing Buddhism to China, once meditated for nine years facing 
a cave wall. Legend has it he tore off his eyelids to maintain 
his focus and wakefulness, epitomizing what I term as 
[Ouroboros-Consciousness](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness)—a heightened 
and intensified state of super or hype-consciousness that 
turns inward upon itself in an accellerating feed back loop. Figures like Bodhidharma and 
other revered saints in Eastern mystical traditions often reach 
such elevated states of consciousness that they lose touch with 
their bodily sensations and their immediate environment. **
Despite his super-conscious state, Bodhidharma would have been 
entirely unaware of his physical body or external surroundings, 
making him poorly equipped to
[
cross a busy New Delhi street](/what-is-meditation#The_Power_of_Conscious_Awareness:_A_Lesson_from_New_Delhi_). In this case, the unaware fool and the 
super-conscious saint look similar.



The Embodiment of Ouroboros Consciousness: From Heights to 
Depths

**This chapter explores what it would look like if the 
Bodhidharmic super-consciousness began to descend into the bodily 
realm. What internal transformations would occur as this spiraling 
vortex of ouroboros-consciousness began to permeate our being as 
body, flowing 
from the crown of our head down to the tips of our toes? **


In the 
context of Indian chakra philosophy, each chakra—meaning 
"*wheel*"—can be understood as a circuit within this spiraling 
ouroboros consciousness.
Within the Vedic system of the seven chakras, the three upper 
chakras correspond to the subtle realms of mind and soul, while 
the three lower chakras are associated with the body and the 
material world. At the center lies the heart chakra, symbolizing 
a harmonious and loving balance point connecting heaven and 
earth.



Here's a concise walkthrough of my interpretation of these 
spiraling circuits from top to bottom. Bear in mind, however, 
that both this representation and the chakra model itself are 
simplified and should be regarded merely as poetic metaphors 
rather than precise descriptions in a western scientific sense.



*Sahasrara *– Pure, abstract consciousness

*Ajna* – Light, vision, intuitive perception, and cognition

*Vishuddhi *– Sound, expression, and communication

*Anahata* – Capacity for love and emotional balance

*Manipura* – Emotional sensations and bodily feelings

*Svadhisthana* – Sensory and tactile bodily awareness

*Muladhara* – Fundamental, granular, pixel-like awareness 
of existence

The Genesis of Ouroboros 
Consciousness

**To encapsulate the odyssey of consciousness, we begin with 
the premise that [awareness](/consciousness/the-mystery-of-awareness) has evolved in tandem with biological 
life itself. Initially, awareness was but a primitive form of 
consciousness that emerged in correlation with the growing 
complexity of living organisms. This nascent, body-centric 
awareness eventually gave rise to higher echelons of 
consciousness, capable of accessing abstract and immaterial 
realms—thoughts, imagination, and even soulful experiences 
beyond the body.


This advanced consciousness 
developed the capacity to break away from its bodily origins. It 
began to generate its own dreams and soar like Icarus toward the 
sun. Empowered by imagination and language, we took on god-like 
abilities to craft our own worlds. Some of these imaginative 
constructs even occasionally led to the invention of new tools 
and social frameworks, enhancing our survival in the external 
environment.



![](/images/cosmic_businessman.jpg)


Ancient yogis and European 
medieval mystics elevated this feature of consciousness even 
further, to a level where consciousness ceased focusing on the 
outer world through the gate of the five senses. Instead, it turned inward, discovering and 
immersing itself in its own essence. In this abyss, it seemed to 
lose itself. 
This could potentially induce megalomania if it were not for the 
fact that every human, in principle, has the capability to 
"galacticize" themselves. **


As elaborated in the
chapter [Ouroboros 
Consciousness](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness), these elevated states of mystic consciousness cut ties with bodily 
sensations, entering into a ceaseless reflective loop with 
itself. Envision this as a cosmic mirror: an internal universe 
endlessly reflecting its core essence. This labyrinth of 
self-reflecting mirrors embodies what we label as 
Ouroboros Consciousness—a looped state of intense, self-contained 
conscious 'suchness' or 'isness.'


Focused intently on nurturing this 
body-transcending super-consciousness, Indian philosophical and 
yogic traditions held that this non-dual, hyper-conscious state 
would find its fullest expression in the 
[ *
crown chakra, 
Sahasrara*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahasrara), the thousand petalled lotus. According to the famous Indian Saint,
[Ramakrishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramakrishna), 
the lowest chakra it could interact with was the 
*[heart chakra, Anahata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anahata')*, 
in a form resembling universal love. When Ramakrishna in old age 
got cancer, advisors knowledgeable in the scriptures, urged him 
to allow his divine concentration descend to his body in order to heal it, Ramakrishna replied: 


*"How can I withdraw the mind from the Lotus Feet of God 


and turn 
it to this worthless cage of flesh and blood?" *


Freed from the trappings of the illusory material world and the 
body as another layer of that illusion, yogis were able to 
induce deeply concentrated states of Ouroboros Consciousness. 
It's within this cultural backdrop that the revered saint 
[Ramana 
Maharshi's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi) proclamation, *The body is a disease in a disease,* 
gains its full meaning. We find similar ways of thinking in 
ancient Greece:


*A man is a dream of a shadow

Σκις ναρ νθρωπος

*Pindar, Pythian 8.95f.


God Wants to be Human****
A central message in this chapter emphasizes a transformative 
shift away from purely disembodied consciousness. The time has 
arrived for luminous, expanded consciousness to fully 
reintegrate into the human body. This pivotal shift occurred 
symbolically with the incarnation of Jesus, representing God's 
deliberate choice to become human. But what is God? God is 
humanity's ultimate projection of its most mysterious and 
unknown inner aspects—God is consciousness itself. I discovered 
this truth independently, only later realizing that C.G. Jung 
had already reached this insight long before. In his profound 
late treatise, *'Answer to Job,'* Jung describes a reverse 
movement: not man's aspiration to become God, but
[God's desire to become man](/love/god-wants-to-be-human).



Jung explains that the light within humanity, despite being 
smaller, is more concentrated than God's omnipresent form. This 
intense concentration precisely mirrors what Ouroboros does to 
consciousness—it intensifies and focuses it. Metaphorically, the 
newly evolved Ouroboric King of Consciousness must reclaim his 
throne within the human heart, governing the body 
comprehensively, from head to toe. However, this throne has 
never been truly vacant. It was previously occupied either by 
the cold kings of reason or various manifestations of the seven 
deadly sins. Yet, the benevolent Ouroboric King does not 
overthrow these occupants by force; instead, he purifies them 
with the warmth of his illuminating presence, transforming them 
into wise counselors.



THE FRAGILITY OF NEWLY EVOLVED SURVIVAL SYSTEMS

**Nonetheless, profound challenges exist on the journey into 
embodied, muddy cellular existence. Enhanced survival complexity 
and expanded response capabilities inevitably come at the cost 
of increased vulnerability. Evolutionarily speaking, the newest 
developments are always the most fragile. When applied to our 
brain—seen as a generator of expanded consciousness—this 
principle becomes less theoretical and more experiential. We 
have all felt how swiftly our conscious awareness can diminish 
under the influence of anger, fear, or any manifestation of the 
so-called seven deadly sins. 'Normal' consciousness can easily 
disintegrate metaphorically showed by Jonas getting swallowed by 
a whale or by the onslaught by dangerous dragons or demons. 
Ouroboic consciousness is even more fragile in such instinctual 
storms of emotions as it is a newer and hence more complex 
survival system. As children are afraid of trolls, we are in the 
childhood of super-consciousness.**


At the culture-evolutionary stages symbolized by ancient Indian 
spirituality and medieval European mysticism, the nascent 
ouroboric consciousness remained highly sensitive to 
disturbances arising from bodily sensations—ego-driven desires, 
existential pain, and turbulent emotions. Such internal 
disruptions could easily destabilize or even sever the delicate, 
newly emerged "brain-flower" of ouroboric consciousness. 
Again, as we all experience both in ourselves and in society, it 
still is prone to fragmentation. However, there might light at 
the end of this evolutionary tunnel. Slowly the new system of 
survival learns to survive.



As "God" returns to inhabit the human body through the spiral 
descent of ouroboric consciousness into the physical realm, the 
introspectively sensed body gradually becomes a beacon of 
intensified conscious awareness. Yet, when precisely does this 
transformative colonization occur? Only once consciousness 
attains sufficient resilience to withstand direct confrontation 
with the tumultuous, raw nature of bodily sensations. If 
consciousness is still immature or delicate, encountering the 
overwhelming intensity of these sensations can risk shattering 
it—much like a small flame extinguished by a strong gust of 
wind. Initially, therefore, consciousness needed to maintain a 
cautious distance from the body, avoiding the risk of being 
overwhelmed and extinguished prematurely.





A weak or undeveloped field of 'god' cannot effectively 
penetrate the dense layers of inherited pain we all carry. This 
situation results in repeated cycles of trauma and 
re-traumatization. In biblical language, the cleansing required 
by consciousness during its descent is the purification of 
ancestral sin. Within this context, what precisely constitutes 
this sin? It is the accumulated biological and bodily pain 
inherent in the experience of living as an animal aware of its 
own sensations and existence.




Jung's Notion of 
Individuation****
The concept of Ouroboros Consciousness—characterized by an 
internal universe continually reflecting its essence in a 
self-replicating loop—finds profound resonance with
[Jung's 
notion of *'individuation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation)*'*. While 
Ouroboros Consciousness in its early developmental stages seeks 
a transcendent state free from bodily constraints, Jung’s 
individuation emphasizes harmonizing all dimensions of human 
experience, including the physical body. Although Jung likely 
embodied a highly developed consciousness himself, he did not 
explicitly articulate this self-reflective aspect of 
consciousness as a distinct phenomenon. His focus remained 
predominantly on the unfolding and integration of the 
personality rather than explicitly highlighting the radiant 
consciousness facilitating its growth.



In a contemporary exploration of spirituality, Ouroboros 
Consciousness is invited to re-engage deeply with our bodily 
interior, aligning closely with Jung's understanding that true 
individuation requires thorough embodiment. Integrating 
Ouroboros Consciousness with bodily awareness manifests as a 
form of divine individuation, uniting ethereal realms with 
physical existence in a holistic realization of human potential. 
Here, the celestial mirrors the corporeal, and spirit finds 
completion not through escape but through profound and intimate 
engagement with the physical world.


Put on the edge, it is not longer 
my job to be god.

It is gods job to be me.


God is foolishly 
in love with me,
it seems he has forgotten heaven and earth
and his happiness and deity,

his entire business seems with me alone.


[Eckhart](/western-mystics#Meister Eckhart 1260-1328)




THE OUROBOIC BODY**



![](/images/body_cross.jpg)


In summary, before engaging the pysical world we must first of 
all enter the realm of our own inner body. Essentially, this 
signifies a return of consciousness to its primordial roots 
deeply anchored within our ancient biological architecture. **
Our brain comprises various 
layers, akin to the rings of a tree. The deeper we delve into 
this neurological 'tree,' the 
[older and more dormant](/consciousness/consciousness-and-evolution) the systems 
we uncover.



Currently, Ouroboros Consciousness—by virtue of its 
recursive nature, constantly feeding back into itself—is poised 
to embark on a conscious journey back to its origins. It does so 
by vigilantly and consciously 'awaring' the inner, interoceptive realm of bodily 
sensations. In ever-deepening spirals of self-referential loops, 
it reverse engineers our entire evolutionary trajectory, 
traveling layer by layer through the body, back to our most 
ancient, pre-Cambrian cellular states, and even further, into 
the elemental stardust that we are made of.



Awareness feels the warmth of the light. Consciousness sees the 
light in the light. In the exiting journey back home the body becomes a 
temple lit with the warm light of consious awareness. We will 
now look at, in detail, how that process takes place. The first 
thing to point out here is that supreme awareness observed from an 
academic lens, is almost retarded.



Enlightenment is sudden - Embodied Oruroboric Consciousness 
is gradual

**In most spiritual traditions, enlightenment is described as a 
sudden event, which makes sense when one considers the nature of 
feedback phenomena. The moment the microphone nears the speaker, 
an instantaneous feedback loop erupts. Ouroboros consciousness 
often manifests in such abrupt fashion.**


However, when it comes to this same consciousness descending 
into the body, the process is gradual, often unfolding over the 
course of a lifetime. On this thrilling journey of super-aware 
individuation, we find contentment even in the smallest 
advancements, for each little step makes today better than yesterday.



Now it's time to probe further into the sensory experiences that 
occur when we 'dive high to soar deep'.




OUROBOIC CONSIOUSNESS DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING**


*Would I have a God whom I could understand, **
I would no longer hold him for 
God.*

[Meister Eckhart](/western-mystics#Meister Eckhart 1260-1328)




*There is nothing to understand

*[Papaji](papaji_and_meditation.htm)


As introverted super-awareness 
manifests within the body, one becomes cognizant of an array of 
internal sensations, many of which defy linguistic and cognitive 
encapsulation. In the words of Papaji, *There is nothing to understand* in this state 
of super-awareness. Instead, using Emanuel S&oslash;rensen's 
terminology, one comes to *'innerstand*' sensory signals in a 
state of pure suchness or isness.



In this heightened state, there are no qualifiers—no *but*,
*if*, *when, what*, or *why*. Super-awareness perceives the 
inner sensory cathedral of the body without analysis, 
transcending ordinary comprehension. Instead of understanding, 
one might say there is knowing.



In this self spiralling light we cannot understand things within 
a normal frame of subject-object relation. Ouroboric consciousness is so endlessly and singular intensely turned upon itself that there is no room for cognitive 
processes as we know them. The singular feedback forms a bridge 
where consciousness crosses over from duality to non-duality. 
Therefore ouroboric consciousness is becoming more and more 
ignorant as it aproaches the feedback singularity.



When the Ourorobos 
descends into the body to become conscious super-awareness, it 
fundamentally retains its self-referential feedback mechanism 
and the same quality of non-understanding. The evolutionary 
trade-off is that this feedback loop compresses all dualistic 
distinctions to a point where traditional cognition becomes 
impossible.


Here there is only a space left for a tsunamic roar of *a-ha*! 





*"When attention turns towards itself,

there is a sense of not-knowing.

When it turns outwards, that which can be known is created."*

— Nisargadatta Maharaj


The non-cognitive Intelligence embedded in Super-Awareness****
Yet, there appears to be a wholly new form of knowing present 
within this vortex of super-aware suchness. Yongey Mingyur 
serves as a beacon for the unfolding of this new intelligence. 
The term 'intuition' falls short in capturing the essence of 
this emergent form of knowing. Words struggle to depict this 
wordless dimension. We encounter the recurring quandary that a 
lower-dimensional system of intelligence
[
struggles to encapsulate](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia#A_CAT_FROM_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_) its more advanced, 
higher-dimensional successor.




The best way for words to point in the right direction is 
through poetry.



You may now wonder: How can intelligence exist in a 
non-cognitive, non-verbal form? Consider the example of
[slime mold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnyuaQ3rvM). 
Intelligence can manifest in numerous ways, yet we often 
overlook these alternative expressions. Much like frogs in a 
well, we are limited by our own frame of reference and find it 
difficult to conceive of the birds soaring in the sky.




This dynamic also sheds light on 
why many, though not all, super-conscious beings often appear 
almost childishly naive when articulating their own states.

[
Yongey Mingur Rinpoche](https://www.lionsroar.com/how-meditation-changes-your-brain-and-your-life/) is arguably one of the most 
super-conscious individuals alive today. Nonetheless, his 
otherwise endearing explanations of his own state are far from 
complex, as evidenced
[in this 
Youtube-clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcd6N7ilwIw). In the hindu and buddhist traditions there are 
countless stories of fools bypassing intelligent people in the 
race for enlightenment.


The Grand Translator****
Intriguingly, the seat of this 
unique form of intelligence seems to reside in the heart. At 
least it is experienced so. As 
[ouroboros consciousness](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness) circles back, it materializes as an 
intense feeling of love, righteousness, and compassionate 
goodness within the heart, imbuing it with profound wisdom. 
The heart is in this sense *The Great Translator*. It 
translates the impersonal, endless and basically cold algoritms governing 
the universe into deep human feelings. From a cosmic 
perspective, one could argue that God is fundamentally 
indifferent to our existence—we are less significant than a 
speck of dust beneath an insect's feet. However, it is through 
the human heart—the "Son of Man"—that God gains the capacity to 
love. Therefore, without the activation of this translating 
mechanism, enlightenment could devolve into a jarring and 
incomplete experience of extreme depersonalization.



While this intelligence is subjectively felt as a deep emotional 
resonance in the heart, it can also be metaphorically viewed as 
a biological transformation—a comprehensive rewiring of the 
brain and body.



Science and imagination

**Science is undeniably a magnificent instrument for understanding 
our world, but it has its limitations—limitations often set by 
the scientists themselves. Occasionally, scientists neglect to 
include themselves as fallible, unknown variables at the end of 
their equations. When they fail to show this humility, they 
inadvertently become the self-assured priests they once opposed 
for centuries.**


Einstein held imagination in high regard, and in that spirit, I 
venture to posit: Ouroboros consciousness harbors within it the 
universe's most potent anti-entropic quality. Yet, this quality 
comes to fruition only when the Ouroboros descends and 
incarnates in the body as spirals of conscious super-awareness. 




It's why 'luck' seems 
to follow those who are super-aware—time and space appear to 
bend as servants in their presence.



The Super-Conscious Bypass****


As discussed in the chapter, *
[The Super-Awake Flow](/love/the-super-awake-flow)*, 
this emergent intuitive intelligence progressively assumes tasks 
and actions that were once governed by a more laborious, 
thought-centered operating system.
One of the many qualities of super-awareness as an 
operating system is its ability to bypass the thought 
operating system and therefore language. I will try to narrow down 
and thus make more tangible the understanding of consciousness 
to the following: Ordinary 'weak' human consciousness can be simplistically 
viewed as an intelligent data processing operating system. This 
operating system is at present centered in an cognition and 
language based 'ego'. This ego operates in duality, both inwardly 
in the form of 'I' and 'me', and outwarly between 'me' and 
'you'.


*
All
creatures contain one reflection:

one, that is the denial of its being
the other;

the highest of the angels denies he is the lowest.


God is the denial of denials.

*

[Meister Eckhart](/western-mystics#Meister Eckhart 1260-1328)


Fundamentally, humans are not 
reliant on the ego's language-based and understanding-centric 
interfaces to perform intelligent actions. The immediacy and 
intuition of super-awareness, bypassing the need for words, 
interact with time and space in ways that seem almost magical 
when compared to the ego's conventional thought processes. 
Intelligent action is born of the super-awakened intuition. 


At Meditation.dk, the ultimate 
treasure—what some might call the Holy Grail—is discovered when 
meditatively nurtured super-awareness transcends the confines of 
the ego's linguistic bubble, plunging deeply into the 
ever-unfolding enigma of life perched on the precipice of 
primal, near-sensory experiences.



In meditation, the intrepid inner explorer can tap into the 
bodily mysteries of the primordial ocean at unfathomable, as-yet 
unnamed depths. The wisdom gained through this super-aware state 
transcends language, though here I rely on words to convey it. 
It's crucial to remember that reading about the moon is not the 
same as actually setting foot on its surface.



Only the Hyper-Aware Can Break the Conceptual Wall

**In this sense, meditative pixelation is metaphorically akin to quantum physics' 
search for smaller and smaller particles. Both quantum physics 
and meditative pixelation share the curious fact that the 
observer affects the observed. An emotion, a sensation, will 
change the moment we consciously notice it in meditation. The 
intensity of this process is proportional to the quantitative 
potency and qualitative clarity of consciousness and attention.**


Unless your attention and consciousness are healthy, hyper-awake, and 
focused, you won't be able to break through and delve within 
yourself. If you are tired, unclear, or stressed, you won't be 
able to tear down the wall between words and wordlessness.



CONSCIOUS AWARENES FOR A NEW AGE

**We are at a pivotal moment where consciousness is reuniting with 
the body it had to leave to evolve on its own. This marks a journey towards 
newly discovered spiritual landscapes.
The consciousness has gained strength both through evolutionary 
maturity and liberation from the physical body.**
Now it is time for a deep dive.



The Blissful Via Dolorosa of Meditation

**Our spirit yearns for the beyond but must now heed the call of 
Earth and darkness. The first walls this spirit will encounter 
are the wall of pain and shame. However, the new spirit seeks 
and loves suffering, and the moment 
it does, it cannot find it—because suffering can only exist as 
something we don't want.


This is what pixellation is all 
about. No sentimental story-telling can go to this war-zone. The 
sufis knew this secret. In no other tradition, suffering has 
been so well understood. The sufi knows that by embracing suffering, the spirit gains blissful depth, a new 
dimension it has never possessed before.While our spirit aspires 
to the transcendent, it must now attend to the realities of 
Earth and its darker aspects. The first obstacles this new 
spirit will confront are the walls of pain and shame. Yet, 
paradoxically, when this spirit seeks and loves suffering, it 
finds that suffering eludes it—for suffering can only manifest 
as something unwanted.**


This is the crux of pixellation. Sentimental narratives hold no 
sway in this complex arena. The Sufis grasped this enigma 
deeply; in no other tradition has suffering been so fully 
comprehended. The Sufi understands that in embracing suffering, 
the spirit acquires a blissful depth, gaining dimensions it 
never previously possessed.



Fuel of Consciousness

**Feelings or "emotions" drive us to act, making them a type of 
energy. This energy serves as the foundation for consciousness, 
and recognizing this is the first step in a transformative inner 
journey.**


I use the term "pixels" to describe the ever-present but 
mostly ignored sensations in our bodies. This term is not meant 
to imply something negative, but rather something intensely 
lived yet unacknowledged.




Becoming constantly aware of this 'pixelated life' inside us is 
the cornerstone of meditation. Discovering this dark energy 
requires true courage; it's not for the faint-hearted.



The First Step Out of Bed

**It's a milestone in our Meditative Life when we discover that 
each of the emotions we thought we knew so well is actually a 
specifically configured bundle of electrochemical sensations. 
Even love dissolves in pure introspective consciousness into an 
electrochemical bodily sensation in the upper part of the chest. 
This realization doesn't make love any less mysterious. Our 
outdated software, our ego-operating system, will never truly 
grasp what is happening. It will convince itself that meditation 
is boring and unnecessary. This reminds me of an ayahuasca 
session I once participated in some years ago. One of my friends 
had perhaps taken three times more ayahuasca than I had. He sat 
outside in the cottage where the session was held, staring at 
the sunset over the ocean. I went out multiple times to check on 
his state. When I looked into his eyes, I could see he was 
completely gone. Nevertheless, he told me: "Nothing is happening 
here. I'm bored. I want to go home."**


Here's a summary of my "purely" meditative experiences. You can 
draw inspiration from them in a kind of open-source field of 
information, where you alone assemble your spiritual software:



When we stand within ourselves in conscious hyper-awareness, the first 
thing that happens is the separation of concepts and sensations. 
Emotions, so to speak, are poured out of their conceptual 
containers and become pure sensory flows. They lose the habitual 
conceptualization that enables us to use them in our cognitive 
metabolism with ourselves and the external world. Here, the 
original sensations stand on their own, recognized as the primal 
energy forms they always were. This inner awareness awakens us 
from a dream-like state, where blind emotional tendrils have 
been controlling the puppet-show life we believed was our real 
existence. In this new inner space, we can't simply recite the 
familiar refrains of our conventional, mundane lives in the same 
way we used to. Declaring "I love/hate you/them" dramatically 
and then acting upon it is not as straightforward as before. For 
here, in the warming light of hyper-consciousness, all feelings, 
whether it's itchy skin or being in love, are perceived in their 
abstract, primal oceanic form. In this state of heightened, 
attentive inward focus, they will be recognized as the elemental 
sensory particles from which all our seemingly well-known 
emotions are constructed.


Sensation is the Fuel of 
Consciousness

**In our standard extroverted state of consciousness, we 
experience these abstract sensations in almost complete inner 
ignorance. The realization of this ignorance about ignorance 
occurs for those who look inwardly and understand that the more 
contact consciousness has with this abstract sensory world, the 
more awakened it becomes. This is because consciousness, like a 
light bulb, draws its energy from the abstract electrical charge 
of sensation.**


Sensation itself serves as the fuel for consciousness. 
Therefore, the spatial expansion and quality of consciousness 
are proportional to its intensity. This means that consciousness 
can only evolve into hyper-awareness by meditatively "biting its 
own sensed tail." The more passionately we look inward at the 
one who is looking, the more awake consciousness becomes.



Only the sensation that has not yet been named and categorized 
by the mind can serve as energy to unfurl this dark sail of 
consciousness. We fall asleep as we name the world. Academics 
are often highly intelligent sleepwalkers for this reason. I 
have a dear friend who 'only' has an education as an 
electrician. Interestingly, his "light of consciousness" is 
among the most enlightened I've encountered, largely due to its 
lack of academic conditioning.



Let Me Repeat the Crucial Insight

**When we look at the observer, an inner spatialized aware space 
is born that wasn't there before the inward focus.**


Feedback and the Infinity Function

This process is identical to the infinity functions that arise 
when a camera is aimed at itself. When the camera 'catches sight 
of itself,' a spiritual door opens in the form of a singular 
infinity function. Notice how objects from the outer world 
interact in a fractal-psychedelic way with this infinity 
function. In meditation, it is not outer objects but inner 
'objects,' in the form of wordless sensory phenomena, that 
interact with the singularly folded mirror of 
superconsciousness. Precisely for this reason, there is no 
spatial infinity present within us until we turn towards 
ourselves.


The Psychedelic Journey and the Apollonian Space of Meditation

**The dynamic singularity of the introverted camera in the aforementioned 
video is more akin to a psychedelic journey than the more Apollonian space 
created in Meditation. Despite the similarities with video introversion, the 
inner space cultivated through Meditation is usually more 'pure,' even 
though Meditation is also capable of occasionally generating visions, 
ranging from pure amusement to grand religious narratives.**


The Journey of Hyper-Awareness Back to the Origins of Life

**The journey of hyper-awareness towards oneself also opens a portal through 
which we travel back to the dawn of creation. For space creates time, and 
time creates space. In the chapter "Consciousness & Evolution," we saw how 
the human body is a biological recycling of all previous life forms. From 
this perspective, Meditation is the psychic archaeology that enables us to 
'witness' where we come from—not in the form of academic knowledge but 
infinitely deeper in the form of ecstatically lived felt-witnessed wisdom!**


Here, I become aware that the deepest sensations of bliss in the flesh of my 
body are, in reality, the original cells of the primordial ocean. In the 
form of the colony of life forms that call themselves 'me,' they continue to 
sing their original simmering primordial songs. Now, I sense-know where I am 
from, or more precisely, in which direction I have come from. For the 
journey back appears to go infinitely further, from the cells of the 
primordial ocean to the nebulae of stardust. Yes, 'I' continue beyond time 
and space and now arrive at a new station, a location-less location where 
everything happens simultaneously right now:



"The happenings of a thousand years ago, days spent millenniums since, are 
in eternity no further off than is this moment I am passing now; the day to 
come a thousand years ahead or in as many years as you can count, is no more 
distant in eternity than this very instant I am in."

— Meister Eckhart



Even this station is not the final stop. It goes on and on and on.



Deep Meditation and Cellular Exploration

**In deep Meditation, one has the opportunity to consciously visit one's own 
dormant primordial body and experience a sea of different operative states. 
With more neuronal connections than there are particles in the universe, the 
hyper-awake brain has the opportunity to delve deeper into the mystery of 
the whole than anything else 'created' in time and space.**


In hyper-aware Meditation, I have experimented with turning on and off 
different layers of these annual rings. The deeper we go, the less awareness 
there is, and the more non-awake attention. In pure attention, we are 
actually not awake. A sleepwalker can, despite not being awake, be so 
attentive that they can balance on the ridge of a roof. The sleepwalker is 
attentive but not conscious. Similarly, one can have a sensible dialogue 
with a patient who has just come out of anesthesia. However, the person is 
not yet awake and, therefore, not self-aware of it. Our animalistic 
operating systems function perfectly well without consciousness.



Hyper-Awareness and the Democracy of Cellular Governance

**Ouroboic** **conscious-awareness presupposes that the colony of cells and bacteria known as a 
human being operates under a democratic governance structure where cellular 
factions collaborate. Hyper-awareness can only arise in a sublime and 
dynamic inner balance point among all our asynchronous and conflicting 
bio-operating systems, down to the churning primordial soup of bacteria 
within us that controls our brain's neurotransmitters.**


What hyper-awareness does is make us cognizant of deeper and deeper layers 
of our impossible existence as asynchronous cell colonies housed under one 
roof. The more the illuminating and warming light of consciousness touches 
even the most remote bacteria and cellular 'stars' in our inner galaxy, the 
better our overall balance becomes. In this sense, we are a galactic 
microcosm surfing a galactic macrocosm. The more awake one is, the better 
one finds the ever-shifting balance point on the surfboard of existence. 
Humanity is the needle's eye where two dimensions collide.

However, as mentioned: just as a PA system can become overwhelmed by feedback 
if not properly managed, our minds and bodies must be robust to 
handle the intensity of self-aware states without losing 
balance. This analogy underscores the 
importance of maintaining both mental and physical health to 
sustain deeper levels of awareness. This holds especially true 
for people who experiment in the sweet spot between psychedelics 
and meditation.



The Ouroboros of Divine Ignorance

**In this endeavor to use the mind to dismantle the alienation 
it itself has wrought, I stumbled upon a bizarre yet utterly remarkable 
potential within our intellect: It can, in a feedback loop 
similar to a policeman handcuffing himself, devour its own tail 
like the [ouroboros snake](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness), 
paving the way for what I dub the highest understanding: divine ignorance. This miraculous 
self-destruction opens the gates for those parts of ourselves 
that we, in our intellectual arrogance, might have scorned as 
crude or simple. **


However, the self-devoured intellect 
re-emerges, not as a repetitive Phoenix reborn from ashes, but as something 
novel and vibrant, humbly assuming the role of a counselor. 
Becoming its own beginning in the end, like the Ouroboros snake, 
the intellect deeply understands that there is fundamentally 
nothing to understand. In this relization, the 
transformed intellect serves as a humble guide to the cosmic 
fool that is our true essence, albeit in a radically different 
context and environment.



The cosmic fool, enigmatic in its presence, takes its place 
within a cathedral of elevated consciousness, a sanctuary 
dedicated to the highest levels of 
[supreme awareness](/ouroboros/embodiment-of-ouroboros). 
This scenario reflects a supreme form of intelligence that is 
simultaneously enveloped in ignorance, akin to the way
[slime 
mould](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spZwZLkMsYw) exhibits a form of super intelligence devoid of 
conscious awareness. In the state of supreme awareness, we 
delegate our cognitive processes in a manner similar to our 
utilization of artificial intelligence. Just as we neither 
comprehend nor need to comprehend the workings of our heartbeat 
or digestive processes, we also let go of the necessity to grasp the 
mechanisms of cognition itself. This realization champions a 
form of wisdom that transcends the conventional need for 
understanding, embracing instead the 
[liberating embrace of 
divine ignorance.](#Super-awareness_does_not_understand_anything_)




A Healthy Soul in a Healthy Body

**In this context, enlightenment can be defined as the 
singular feedback of consciousness into itself. Here, Rumi’s 
metaphor of "polishing the mirror" becomes essential. 
Consciousness, together with its capacity for high-quality, 
focused experiences, must reach a critical point—a point of no 
return—to enter this singular feedback state. Conversely, a dull 
or inattentive consciousness will struggle to reach such 
profound depth.**


It's important to note that the quality of self-referential 
amplification depends on the quality of attention given. Dull and low-quality 
concentration cannot reach the point of no return, which is necessary for 
consciousness to enter the state of singular feedback. An attention interface 
that is too obsessed with chasing external objects will only meet with boredom 
when looking inside.



This state of singular feedback, which I define as 
enlightenment, occurs when consciousness is amplified into consciousness in such 
a way that it comes close to the singularity. The capability of high-quality 
experience in consciousness and its correlation with time-space is necessary for 
consciousness to reach this point.
