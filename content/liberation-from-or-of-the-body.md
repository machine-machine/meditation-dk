LIBERATION *FROM* OR *OF* THE BODY

**This chapter expands on the ideas presented in the previous 
chapter, 


[Eastern versus Western 
Consciousness.](/civilization/eastern-versus-western-consciousness) I recommend reading that chapter 
first for better context.**



What is freedom?
There are many concepts of what freedom is and how to realise it. 
However, in spiritual matters, two radically different types of 
freedom seems to be at play: the freedom 
*of*** the body and its experiences, or freedom ***
from*** the body, expressed as a liberation from the 'I' 
and ego.**



Embedded in the historical DNA of spiritual traditions in both 
the East and West is the belief that the body and physical life 
are obstacles to true freedom. As a result, these traditions 
have predominantly sought liberation *from* the body, 
understood as dis-identification from physical existence.



The duality between 'spirit' and 'flesh' has, at times, been 
approached through more nuanced perspectives, where body and 
soul could harmoniously coexist. The Greek ideal of a beautiful 
soul in a beautiful body represents one such synthesis. To some 
extent, Buddha’s realization of the Middle Way—where he rejected 
extreme ascetic practices like near-starvation—can also be seen 
as a softened stance toward the body. Similarly, the Chinese 
portrayal of the joyful Bodai, with his rice bowl, embodies a 
balance of physical contentment and spiritual peace.



Later Christian thought, particularly during the Renaissance and 
post-Reformation periods, began to embrace a more positive view 
of the body, partly due to the revival of classical Greek 
ideals. Catholic thinkers like Thomas Aquinas, for example, 
argued that body and soul are united in human beings, and that 
the resurrection of the body is central to Christian 
eschatology—suggesting that the body is not inherently in 
opposition to the soul’s spiritual journey toward God.

LIBERATION *FROM* THE BODY

**One fine morning in his humble Lucknow home in 1995,
[Papaji](papaji_and_meditation.htm) read a local 
Indian newspaper story about a newborn baby in a New York 
hospital who supposedly cried out at birth, *"Oh no!... not 
again!"* With tears of laughter, Papaji recounted the tale to 
the visitors already packed into his small living room.**


In comparing Eastern and Western spirituality, India stands out 
for its traditions that most emphatically negate the body. 
Papaji's teacher, Ramana Maharshi famously went so far as to 
call the body a *“disease within a disease.”* It’s 
intriguing that, despite Papaji’s humor and Ramana’s more solemn 
outlook, both shared an alignment with the philosophy of maya, 
which views the material world as an illusion. Their contrasting 
responses reveal the varied ways enlightenment can embody this 
perspective. It also remind us that true spiritual insight 
cannot be attained by merely copying a master on a personal 
level.

*



*Both the baby’s cry and Ramana Maharshi’s teachings 
encapsulate the essence of Eastern belief, where human life is 
fundamentally viewed as suffering, creating a deep yearning for 
escape. We are caught in an endless cycle of birth and death, 
and the ultimate goal is to break free from it. In Hinduism, 
this liberation is called Moksha, while in Buddhism, 
it is known as Nirvana. From this elevated 
perspective, the difficult and often painful existence of the 
body is seen as an illusion—much like a dreamer waking from a 
nightmare, realizing with relief that all the fear and torment 
were nothing but a figment of the mind.




India has fostered countless stories that illustrate this theme, 
such as the following: A man enters a dimly lit room and sees a 
snake. Terrified, he scrambles to find safety. But when the 
light is turned on, he realizes the snake was merely a rope 
hanging on the wall.



The grand escape from this miserable and yet illusive material wold is achieved by meditating oneself out of 
earthly existence. Through a process of spiritual purification, 
where the body's thirst for life is neutralized, the vicious 
cycle of rebirths is transcended. The spirit is then liberated 
from the confines of bodily existence.




Thus, the highest human ideal in these traditions is freedom 
from desires. A person free of desires can even surpass the 
gods. As stated in the Puranas:



*"There is nothing the gods 
fear more than a person who desires nothing."

*

The paradox, however, is that the spirit can only become free 
from the body after it has first disciplined the body to cease 
following its natural instincts.



UNTIMELY FRACTURES BETWEEN BODY AND SPIRIT

**How is it that India fostered such a deep disregard for the 
body and its life, while in China, Taoist sages were busy 
developing spiritual techniques and concocting potions aimed at 
prolonging life? Early European Christianity, too, was closely 
aligned with the Eastern view, emphasizing the need to transcend 
the physical. Yet, Christ was resurrected in bodily form, 
suggesting a different perspective on the body’s role in the 
divine order. These contrasting views on whether the body could 
have a place among the gods highlight the role of civilization 
itself as a key force shaping spiritual beliefs and practices.**



**In India, the harshness of existence—marked by cycles of 
drought, famine, and disease—may have reinforced a desire to 
escape the physical realm, leading to a spiritual focus on 
moksha, or liberation from the body’s limitations. I have in 
detail described this aspect of meditation as a
[
survival response to famine and catastrophy here](/civilization/eastern-versus-western-consciousness#Illusion_as_a_Survival_Response_to_Catastrophes_).**


Yet, there 
seems also to be other civilisatoric modulators in the game.

****
Both in the East and the West, there have long been ongoing 
conflicts between our biological "animal" nature and the 
remarkable ability of the mind to imagine new possibilities. The 
fluid mind, capable of instantly grasping and creating utopian 
visions of how we might interact and understand ourselves, often 
moves far faster than the body. The body, like an old elf in 
wooden clogs, struggles to keep pace, weighed down by ancient 
instinctual hardware and outdated cultural software. It resists 
the disruptive changes brought about by the soaring, ambitious 
Icarus-mind.



From my historical perspective, 
these conflict seem to follow a distinct pattern. We become 
"civilized" in waves. The transition from a hunter-gatherer 
existence to an agricultural life demanded a radical 
intensification of self-control. Similarly, the shift from 
agrarian life to imperial living in larger cities required 
further retraining of our behavior. This pattern
[continues through 
history](/civilization/civilization-and-consciousness), marked by various transformative examples.




These tensions are especially pronounced at the fractures 
between old and new social orders, especially when the new order 
manifest in a disruptive way what it often seems to do.




As civilization 
advances—becoming more complex and affluent—the primitive and 
instinctual body is often left behind, reprimanded by the new 
demands of society. The more sophisticated the social order 
becomes, the more the body, with its ancient impulses, struggles 
to keep up.



To keep it simple, we all know how easy it is to adapt new ideas 
on a mental level and how difficult it is at the same time 
really to change behaviour according to our new ideals.



The older our biological "operating systems," the harder they 
are to adapt during times of change. These older systems are 
largely unconscious, and without consciousness, change becomes 
even more difficult. Moreover, the archaic parts of our biology 
were shaped over vast aeons, far removed from the rapid cultural 
changes of the last 2,000 years.



In disruptive transitional phases, the willing and visionary spirit 
and the instinct-ridden, lustful, fearful, aggressive and first 
of all habit-driven body 
have stood against each other like dog and cat. Only with the 
application of large doses of both carrot and stick have the 
archaic instinct-programmed systems within us "understood" and 
sluggishly learned the new behavioral demands dictated by 
societal consciousness. After a few generations, it seems that 
the new cultural behavior becomes habitually embedded as a norm, 
resulting in a temporary truce between spirit and body.





THE WESTERN ADAPTION OF 'MAYA'

** ***The Contemporary War between Body and Spirit

***I think we can all agree that we once again are living in 
disruptive times of such magnitude that our old world order is 
shaking from top to bottom. At first glance, we may not see 
body-renouncing ascetics walking the streets with beggar bowls, 
but the dualism between reality and ideality has grown far more 
pronounced over the last 20 years. This dualism has assumed new 
forms, which, while they don’t resemble the old manifestations, 
still produce soldiers in the ongoing war between body and 
spirit. This conflict creates suffering, which in turn 
reinforces the polarization that the spirit attempts to overcome 
through its own imaginative realms.**


Let me give some examples of this conflict zone. A growing 
number of young people are increasingly dissatisfied with the 
body they received in the genetic lottery. For some, it takes 
the form of young men striving obsessively to develop 
Adonis-like bodies. For women, this dissatisfaction 
might be surgically compensated with new noses, lips, or 
breasts. And in a more extreme 
manifestation, with the aid of new technologies, the spirit now 
claims that gender itself is merely a matter of choice.



I can’t help but see this as a recurrence of the age-old war 
against the body, with the same catch-22 that religious 
renunciates of the past faced: the spirit can only become free 
from its hatred of the body after it has first disciplined the 
body to cease following its natural biology.



We are now in high-tech times where the cultural and technological shifts 
enable people to "reinvent" their physical selves in ways 
previously unimaginable. Here I see the rise of body 
modification, extreme fitness culture, and debates around gender 
identity as manifestations of this ongoing conflict.



When did this resent body-negation start?



Hippie Freedom and Self-restraint

**My guess is that**
**the youth rebellion and the hippie movement in the 60'ties 
initiated this new wave. It birthed a mind who would throw the 
same culture from its sensual and spiritual hedonism into a 
disciplinary anti-thesis. In my view, it is no coincidence that 
Steve Jobs was both a free wheeling Indian loving psychedelic hippie and a control freak. Only such 
an anachronism was able to create the abyss we all gaze into 
today: the smartphone. **


Steve Jobs' favorite spiritual book was *
[
Autobiography of a Yogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi)* by Paramahansa Yogananda. He was 
deeply inspired by it and reportedly re-read it many times 
throughout his life. Autobiography of a Yogi also made a 
significant impression on Mark Zuckerberg. In 2015, during a 
trip to India, he shared that Steve Jobs recommended the book to 
him when he was going through a challenging period at Facebook. 
Jobs suggested it would help him reconnect with a sense of 
purpose and the "bigger picture" of his work and life.



In this context, it is interesting that several influential 
people, including Elon Musk, with scientific evidence behind 
them, are convinced that the reality we live in is a simulation. 
It is, in fact, not real.



Musk’s philosophical influences tend to focus on existential 
questions around technology, humanity’s future, and survival, 
rather than spiritual or mystical perspectives. However, Musk 
does share a similar drive for purpose and impact, a theme that 
resonates with the spiritual journeys described in works like 
Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi.



One of the central themes of this chapter is that the 
technology-derived digital realm itself embodies a more 
spiritual than material existence, one where we are free to 
invent avatars as replacements for the identities once shaped by 
biology and society. This shift draws us into a fundamentally 
body-negating universe.



Identity and body are 
deeply intertwined. In a world with diminishing ties to a 
physical body, we can become whatever entity we choose—or that 
chooses us. This is precisely what children growing up with 
computer games learn: we pick our character before the game 
begins. With a few clicks, we can transform into heroes, 
villains, men, women, or even mythological creatures. This early 
shift away from traditional, inherited identities contributes to 
a parallel rise in anxiety, which paradoxically makes us cling 
even more tightly to “identities.” Whether these identities are 
based on gender, race, or politics, they often become, in the 
absence of a grounded connection to physical reality, abstract 
constructs searching for concrete form. Identity, once shaped by 
the body, family, and culture, is now increasingly a matter of 
active choice—much like selecting characters in a digital world.



Much like in *The Matrix*, physical embodiment is no longer 
essential for engaging in digital reality.



In this way, the mind-dominated digital world echoes ancient 
Indian philosophies suggesting the physical world may be an 
illusion. Today, however, “simulation” and “hologram” have 
become the preferred terms. This insight places us within a 
polarized space, balancing between hedonism and extreme 
self-control, as we navigate digital experiences that liberate 
yet distance us from the physical self.



Consider social media personas as an example of this tension. On 
platforms like Instagram or TikTok, people curate idealized 
versions of themselves, choosing avatars, filters, and content 
that align with aspirational identities rather than their 
everyday realities. This can offer liberation from physical and 
social limitations, enabling individuals to embody new 
aesthetics, values, or personas.



Yet, the pursuit of digital approval often fosters obsessive 
self-monitoring and an endless need to uphold an “ideal” online 
presence, introducing a hyper-discipline that results in real 
physical consequences—such as feelings of inadequacy, body 
dissatisfaction, or anxiety. Much like traditional hedonistic 
pursuits that promise pleasure but foster self-doubt, there is 
also a tendency to shape and discipline the body to resemble its 
digital avatar.




Ancient people had every reason to flee from the body. Freedom from the 
self, from bodily existence, made perfect sense, for only a few lived beyond 
the age of 40, and no one could be sure what tomorrow would bring in terms 
of war, catastrophe, hunger, or disease. The risk of a violent death was 
extremely high. Viewing the world as an illusion was, therefore, an 
appropriate survival strategy, especially in India, which, due to frequent 
monsoon failures and an overly caste-divided society, could never figure out 
how to face challenges collectively. Indians thus developed meditation as an 
anti-body survival solution in an inherently over-fragmented, dysfunctional 
society. The logic of "What is lost externally must be gained internally" 
drove this Indian meditation practice, leading to a form of spiritual 
liberation through alienation from the life of the body. Now the question is 
how we in the contemporary West can harwest from these 
experiences.






MY STORY: HOW DID I DIGEST THE ILLUSIVE ILLUSION?

**It was—and still is—quite common in my spiritual circles to 
hear people claim that the world is an illusion. Statements 
like, "Nothing truly exists," are often repeated, especially in 
New Age communities influenced by Vedantic and Buddhist philosophy. 
The same concept also bleeds into the various mordern trends 
that view our existence as a simulation. In these 
circles, the philosophy of illusion goes beyond a mere critique 
of our superficial, influencer-driven, reality-TV-saturated 
world. Here, the concept of illusion expands to include all the 
moving parts of time and space.**



Liberation Through Alienation

**For many years of my younger 
life, I fled inward every time I faced problems in my outer life. When I had 
trouble with a girlfriend, I fled into the *"I am not the body"* meditation.**



Was it a good idea? Hardly... The problems didn’t disappear because I 
practiced ostrich meditation. On the contrary, many precious years passed, 
during which I could have learned to navigate life’s tricky whirlpools as a 
more down to earth human being. Instead, I chose, during difficult periods, to depersonalize 
myself into pure spirit.



Throughout my life, I’ve seen this survival strategy used countless times by 
sensitive vulnarable modern, Western-conditioned people. For people with mental anguish and 
struggles in daily life, it is all too tempting to reuse or perhaps misuse 
ancient Eastern spiritual DNA to liberate themselves through alienation.



The *'Spiritual Bypass'*

**A Japanese Zen monk once gave a lecture on meditation on the top floor of a 
skyscraper in Tokyo. Suddenly, a small earthquake caused the building to 
sway dangerously. People panicked and rushed out of the building. Only the 
Zen master remained seated. When the earthquake was over, the audience 
returned to the lecture hall, where the Zen master sat, unmoving, in serene 
calm, eyes closed. When people asked why he didn’t flee, he replied:




*“While you fled out, I fled in.”**
*

In meditation, you let the world be the world and adapt yourself instead.

The colossal freedom potential in this 'flight' is dizzying and 
awe-inspiring and yet at the same time problematic.


I came 
to understand the dangers of spiritual intro-escapism through 
personal experience and later through my encounter with a new 
wave of spirituality led by
[Bhagwan 
Rajneesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneesh). Unlike many spiritual leaders, Rajneesh took the 
traumas and struggles of ordinary life seriously, blending 
modern therapy with meditation. At the time, this felt like a 
fresh breeze, a revitalizing shift in spiritual practice.



Later, I realized Rajneesh wasn’t alone in the insight that 
meditation, unless purposefully directed to support personal 
growth, could easily become a survival technique akin to an 
ostrich burying its head in the sand—an escape from reality. 
Psychologist John Welwood had already coined the insightful term 
"spiritual bypass" in the early 1980s to describe this 
phenomenon, referring to the tendency to use spiritual practices 
as a way to avoid confronting unresolved emotional issues, 
psychological wounds, or unfinished personal development.



Welwood observed that spiritual bypassing happens when 
spirituality is used as a means to evade painful feelings, 
unresolved traumas, or relational challenges, rather than 
engaging with them in a healthy and grounded way. Interestingly, 
Rajneesh and Welwood were aligned in their thinking, 
demonstrating how related insights often emerge concurrently. 
Even
[
Transcendental Meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation), popularized by Maharishi Mahesh 
Yogi in the 1970s, showed a shift toward valuing the material 
world alongside the spiritual. Maharishi promised a "200 percent 
life," with both 100% material fulfillment and 100% spiritual 
life, suggesting a newfound respect for the body's role in 
personal growth.



What strikes me now as particularly strange is how, like many 
around me, I found myself navigating two parallel paths that 
rarely intersected. On one hand, I practiced radical body 
negation; on the other, I pursued therapeutic practices focused 
on healing bodily traumas and improving my material 
circumstances. This dichotomy recalls Gurdjieff’s observation 
that each of us harbors more than a hundred different 
personalities, many of which remain unaware of each other. 
Fascinatingly, this split mirrors the recurring paradox of body 
negation versus body discipline—a theme that weaves through 
historical and cultural conflicts between body and spirit.



Ultimately, everything comes down to ensuring that one hand 
knows what the other is doing. Today, I view this dual approach 
as emblematic of my generation of spiritual seekers, 
encapsulating both our drive to transcend and our need to heal.




New Age – Illusion or Ferrari?

**New Age organizations today continue to grow, drawing on the 
religious DNA of the East in the sense that most modern 
meditation traditions still carry within them Buddhism’s or 
Hinduism’s ancient longing to escape the troublesome existence 
of being human. At the same time, the dreams of bodily happiness 
are marketed in such a way that it’s hard to tell whether the 
project is about wellness or the negation of earthly life. A 
variety of reinterpretations are trying to find their way in a 
landscape where, at one moment, you are supposed to rise above 
the illusory body and not take the ego seriously, and in the 
next, you are doing everything possible to make the body feel 
extra comfortable with therapy, massage, personal development, 
tantra, mindfulness, and fine dining. Add to that the American 
dream, which promotes the idea that mindfulness and positive 
thinking are the way to the Ferrari you’ve always dreamed of.**



An arsenal of pop-smart livelihood gurus preach and talk, but it 
makes little difference. The foundation, which is rarely 
questioned, is old and shaky, especially if it is meant to 
support a dream of material success. Let me emphasize that 
there’s nothing inherently wrong with desiring a Ferrari. The 
issue is the inconsistency in the cultural software of 
meditation.





In this Western interpretation of Vedanta, life itself is viewed 
as illusory.



I, too, have made similar statements and 'believed' the world to 
be an illusion. But now, I find myself asking:



Why did I say that in the first place?



In my 47 years of meditating, I've observed how the invisible 
aspects of the ideology that accompanies meditation subtly shape 
our perception of reality. The small, almost imperceptible 
things we repeat over the years contribute to creating the map 
that guides us through life and defines where we belong. From 
the micro to the macro, everything flows as information that 
shapes us—whether we are conscious of it or not.




However, even the slightest misalignment between this 
ideological map and our 
[
'core personality'](/civilization/inner-and-outer-person#IS_THERE_ANYTHING_AUTHENTIC_IN_ME_) will eventually create obstacles on our 
spiritual path. Without harmony between the smallest and largest 
aspects of ourselves and what we absorb, we will gradually 
experience stagnation.




Life in the New Age scene has taught me that I often built my 
life on 'truths' from external sources, which slipped into my 
system without proper scrutiny. In my blind rebellion against 
the authority of my own culture, I plunged into reverence for 
exotic authority. Uncritically, I adopted foreign religious and 
cultural beliefs, only to later realize that I was filled with 
undigested ideas that were neither truly my own nor beneficial 
to me.



Let me offer a small example: I rejected Christianity as pure 
hypocrisy, only to find myself singing devotional bhajans to the 
elephant god Ganesh or the monkey god Hanuman. I didn’t grow up 
around elephants or monkeys, yet here I was, praising them. 
Worse still, my rejection of Western authority led to an 
uncritical submission to father-figure substitutes in the form 
of misguided gurus.




My goal now is to bring these external ideas into the light for 
closer inspection. Like using tweezers, I must dissect my 
meditation practice down to its smallest details. Only those 
pieces of information that pass the critical test of both the 
intellect and intitution in honesty will be allowed to integrate 
into my new spiritual DNA.



So I repeat the question:



What does it really mean to say that the world is an illusion?



Is it even appropriate to view what’s right in front of our 
noses as illusory?



Based on my own inner experiences, I can confirm that there is a 
galactic perspective where 'one' is, so to speak, led out of the 
protective walls of the ego and the body, rising above roofs, 
cities, countries, and further inside-out, so far that the 
planet we call Earth, then the solar system, and finally the 
galaxies seem no larger than a molecule in a speck of dust. I 
could also call it a location-less location of consciousness, 
devoid of anything other that the swirling of *that* into 
*that*.



From in-out here-there, our little, ever-changing lives seem 
utterly insignificant and, in that sense, an illusion.



However, less will also suffice. Many will surely recognize 
moments in meditation, so still and deep, where many desires, 
tasks, or problems that once seemed significant now seem 
non-existent.




However, it should be clear by now that I am no longer certain 
about the absolute truth of seeing and especially living the 
world as an illusion.




Have we really been given a body and a world just to abandon 
them in favor of a depersonalized spiritual perspective?




As far as I can see, a self-reinforcing loop of conclusions 
forms in the relationship between illusion and detachment: We 
leave the world because it is an illusion. When we leave the 
world, it becomes an illusion.




The spiritual eagerness to label our bodily life as an illusion 
or a simulation, therefore, makes me suspicious. What is the 
motive behind this devaluation of body-time in space?




The Indian philosophical argument is that everything that 
changes is illusory. Today you are young healthy. Tomorrow you 
are old and seriously ill. Today your wife loves you. Tomorrow 
she has left you. Don’t attach yourself to life, for it is 
samsara, ever-changing, and change creates suffering. Therefore, 
attach yourself to the unchanging in the form of eternity, God, 
the Self, Spirit, Nirvana, the Ground of Being, or 
Consciousness. For only the unchanging can be considered real.



Now my question is: Does the Indian conclusion hold, that 
'something' does not exist because 'it' changes?




Could this argument actually be hiding an unwillingness to face 
life’s hardships?




Why is suffering considered so terrible? Why not see it instead 
as an integral part of a changing but wonderful life of sunshine 
and storms?




I, therefore, allow myself to view the illusionary perspective 
as a potential expression of escapism.




Why have we been given a body if the whole point of the game is 
simply to leave it?




Seeing the world as an illusion makes it easier to escape 
existential responsibility for what is… here and now… right in 
front of us. Calling something illusory is the same as 
downgrading its value.




Suffering is easier to 'survive' when it’s just an illusion 
anyway.




I call it liberation through alienation.



Depersonalization as a Survival Strategy

**The very idea that the world is an illusion, in the sense 
that it is not always what it appears to be, is in itself a 
wonderful philosophical and cognitive discovery. **


The new scientifically grounded thoughts that the world is 
actually a simulation are groundbreaking. I don’t see it as a 
coincidence that the elite of the Western world are now 
rediscovering the concept of illusion in the form of simulation 
theory. For, as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the 
body and the spirit are once again at odds.




The philosophy of illusion can, as long as it merely poses 
critical, skeptical questions about the beer-drinking existence 
we automatically take for granted, have the potential to develop 
into a theology of freedom.




The problem only arises when this philosophy becomes a norm, a 
dogma, an unchallenged and unexamined foundational assumption 
upon which the rest of the narrative of existence is 
constructed—a narrative that often practices what Buddha would 
call a thirst for life.




Why?

**My gadget-guru Steve Jobs kept asking people who worked in 
different business organizations: *Why* do you do what you 
do? No one could really answer. The only response was: We do 
what we’ve always done, what we’ve been told to do. Steve Jobs 
had enough awareness to see through the routine sleepiness in 
these answers, and with this insight, he was able to change work 
procedures so they became meaningful.**


We are hopelessly stuck in habits and sleep. It doesn’t matter 
whether we’re talking about a business empire, an academic 
institution, or a meditation organization. For that reason 
alone, all tradition-based meditation organizations should 
subject themselves to a thorough revision a la Jobs.



The dilemma in meditative circles—whether the body is worth 
investing in or whether it is an illusion to be transcended—is a 
very real one. The liberation of the self can often be 
uncomfortable. The pain, which is a fundamental condition of 
living in a body and interacting with other bodies and the 
world, is still there, even if you flee from it into the world 
of the spirit. It makes sense for sensitive people in a modern 
big-data world to reuse the old Indian depersonalization 
techniques, where one liberates oneself from oneself. It’s 
almost too easy to use meditation as a spiritual bypass of the 
body and everyday life. A depersonalized life without integral 
bodily existence, however, offers no spiritual fullness or 
depth. I would go so far as to call it a waste of life.



As mentioned, the body and spirit, after a long period from the 
60s to the turn of the millennium, are once again on a collision 
course. The only thing I am critically concerned with here is 
the lack of meta-awareness in this conflict. The sleepy 
meditative environments need more restless but wakeful Steve 
Jobs archetypes to ask questions about everything between heaven 
and earth.



**In a time like ours, with dizzying speeds of change in our 
self-perception and the interfaces through which our 
metamorphosing identities navigate, the body is left behind like 
a fossilized turtle while the hare’s soul in us hurries to put 
on new virtual bodies.**


This separation already happens on a micro level the second you 
forget that your body feels anxious because you got a like on a 
photo of a dessert you posted on Facebook.



In this context, it is no coincidence that Steve Jobs took a 
meditative pilgrimage to India in his youth and remained friends 
with the book Autobiography of a Yogi for the rest of his life. 
Silicon Valley is, if anything, a postmodern Buddhist/Hindu 
melting pot, spiced with microdoses of LSD. Nor is it a 
coincidence that Indians are so good at programming. They are 
used to handling "nothing."






LIBERATION *OF* THE BODY**



*"God enjoys himself in all things."**
– Meister Eckhart



"Real knowledge, even in this body,

is intrinsically so delightful

that the sum total of created things

is nothing to the joys of pure perception."

– Meister Eckhart



"God delights so in this likeness that

he pours out his whole nature,

his whole substance into it, in his own self.

The joy and satisfaction of it are ineffable.

It is like a horse turned loose

in a lush meadow, giving vent to his

horse-nature by galloping full-tilt about the field:

he enjoys it, and it is his nature."

– Meister Eckhart*



The organic-chemical cultural mutations between digital technological 
expansion and the spiritual traditions of the East are already countless and 
unpredictable. Add to this brew the psychedelic information coming from the 
shamans of South America.



In this sea of possibilities, I choose—with respect for all the possible and 
impossible hybrids that the liberation from the body can take in a world 
where spirit will likely shed its old shell and inhabit cybernetic 
organisms—a different path.



I call it the liberation of the body as a path to liberation from the body.



On this path I will now give my take on what reality is:



What is real? It is what the heart touches. Whatever the heart 
chooses to love becomes real in a psychological sense. What the 
heart does not love becomes unreal, an illusion.



Individuation in Super-Awareness

**It makes sense to view humans as a tree. The tree’s root system is our 
unconscious biology, which carries millions of years of 
[accumulated 
biological operating systems](/consciousness/consciousness-and-evolution). In the treetop exists what grows in the light 
of consciousness.**


Most of the body’s inner biological life is hidden, not because it is 
repressed, but because it is wordless, and therefore unknown and 
incomprehensible. No historical figure, to my knowledge, has pointed more 
clearly to the human roots’ diverse depth and importance than the 
psychologist C.G. Jung:



*"Man's task is to become conscious of the

contents that press upward from the unconscious."

*– C.G. Jung



Jung called the process of becoming conscious of oneself "individuation." 
For Jung, however, individuation was inseparably connected to the world of 
words and understanding. For him, understanding was a central tool for the 
spiritual locksmith’s work of unlocking the door to the unconscious.



I, however, see a new ruler, radically different from the king of words, 
conquering the continent of the body!



This ruler is born at a balance point created by ouriboic super-awareness as 
explained [in this chapter](/ouroboros/embodiment-of-ouroboros).



The Incomprehensibly Wordless Super-Awareness

**Once upon a time, deep in the heart of the Russian Empire, there lived three 
monks on an isolated island in the middle of a large lake. They had almost 
no contact with the civilized world. They knew very little about Christian 
theology. Their only prayer was: "We are three. You are one. Lord, have 
mercy on us."**


A bishop heard about these three hermits and decided to visit them. He rowed 
a long way out on the lake until he finally reached the small island. The 
monks greeted him with great love and humility. However, the bishop was 
deeply surprised by how little the three knew about Christian theology and 
decided to stay on the island for a few days to give them a crash course in 
Christianity. The hermits were deeply grateful for the bishop’s teachings 
and thanked him many times as they bid him farewell. The bishop rowed back 
toward the mainland. Halfway out, he heard the monks calling after him. He 
turned and saw the three running across the water. "Lord," they said, "we 
have forgotten your teachings. Can you repeat what you said?"



The holy simplicity of the three hermits renders theology, and in a broader 
sense, the very phenomenon of ‘understanding’ unnecessary in a form of 
incomprehensible super-conscious wisdom. To understand something is to grasp 
it. Who wants to grasp it? It is the ego, which eternally desires to 
transform things by grasping control through the proces of undertanding. The ego desires 
understanding. Understanding brings power. In super-conscious wisdom, however, we let go of 
everything we have grasped.



The super-conscious highway is therefore also the flyover that bypasses the 
ego’s futile attempts to spiritualize itself through self-development. This 
is not to say that one can do without therapy or psychological insight, 
which, to continue the highway metaphor, could be compared to the essential 
on-ramps. The overwhelming mass of texts on Meditation.dk consists of 
on-ramps to the super-conscious highway. This articulation knows its place 
as a servant and makes room for what is most important—awareness, which, 
when you inhale a perfume whose name you don’t know, makes you aware of the 
scent.



The Super-Awareness Colonization of the Body’s Wilderness

**Meditation.dk is an artistic life project that, step by step, brings 
super-consciousness to the dark, attentive body micro-world without words. 
In this sense, meditation is the psychic microscope of super-awareness. It 
incarnates in the body as a wordless and understanding-less spatial realm of 
abstract clarity. The colonization of the body by super-awareness is 
radically different from the otherwise praiseworthy body-consciousness 
behind the desire to exercise and eat healthily. It pales in comparison to 
the consciousness that suddenly becomes aware of the deafening roar of our 
cells’ living wave-rush. The body’s cosmic background radiation is 
here—always. However, we only become aware of our foot the moment we sprain 
it. When it functions, we ‘forget’ it. We only hear the fridge hum when it 
stops. Through change, we become aware that the hum was there all along. Now 
the task is to become aware of THAT which never changes.



Meditation is about cultivating a consciousness that perceives 
the age-old timeless cellular essence within us. It involves journeying deeply 
[into the sensory realm of the body](/fields/meditative-pixelation), discovering that the path 
inward is also the path outward. Through this process, we 
liberate ourselves from the confines of the body by first 
freeing the body itself, creating a harmony between presence and 
transcendence.



It's about learning to shake hands with oneself, so that both 
hands—and all parts of our being—truly know knowing.



May we first understand, then free ourselves from understanding. 
And may we then *'innerstand'* in pure simple awareness.
