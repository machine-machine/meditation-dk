God wants to be Human

GOD WISHES 
TO BECOME HUMAN

* For 
God can only love in a human heart*




*God needs me as much as I need Him.

*Eckhart




Humans are often characterized as a species 
perpetually striving to transcend boundaries. Particularly in Western cultures, 
this endeavor is outward-facing, marked by a relentless drive to overcome 
external challenges through technology and science. In contrast, Eastern 
traditions, [notably in India](/civilization/eastern-versus-western-consciousness), 
have historically focused this quest inward, seeking to overcome internal 
barriers.



To become God

**Both approaches, whether outward or inward, can arguably be seen as a 
deep-seated yearning to connect with what might be considered humanity's most 
profound projective creation: GOD. **


God is perfect. We humans are not.




*Creature comforts are inherently flawed and 
incomplete,

but God's comfort is whole, without any shortcomings.

*Eckhart




Among all boundaries, death remains the most 
formidable challenge. In India, numerous tales of Yogis who, through specific 
meditation techniques, have extended their lifespans to almost mythic 
proportions are well-known. Another path pursued by Indian yogis to attain 
godliness involves the annihilation of both the ego and the body through 
self-control. In extreme cases, like in the Jain culture, it is viewed as an 
honor for the whole family if a young memember decides in the name of 
spirituality, to starve himself to death in a ritual called Sallekhana. This 
subtly yet potently implies that in transcending death, either by anihilating 
the body or prolonging its life, humans edge closer to a divine state of being.



In the Western world, this aspiration is evident in the escalating interest in 
life extension and the enhancement of life quality. A notable figure in this 
movement is [Bryan Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/@BryanJohnson), 
who is at the forefront of this trend, striving valiantly to surpass the 
constraints of the human condition. I offer him my best wishes in these 
ambitious pursuits.



To become Human**




*What you seek is seeking you.**
*Rumi




However, in this discussion, we will shift our 
focus to explore an entirely different approach: envisioning a scenario where 
God wishes to become human. This is in my view encapsulated in the narrative of 
the Son of God.

Jesus is God becomming man.




The question then is: What does God 'desire'? What 
interest could the Limitless have in the small, limited human? The Meister puts 
it this way:




*God is foolishly in love with us,

it seems he has forgotten heaven and earth

and his happiness and deity,

his entire business seems with me alone...*

Meister Eckhart




The Meister provocatively even states:




I never give God thanks for 
loving me,

because he cannot help it.





The Trial of Job in the Book of Job

**As C.G. Jung articulates in 'Answer to 
Job,' the character of Job, subjected to trials by Yahweh, is portrayed as more 
sympathetic than the divine tester. Job, in his human fragility, 'triumphs' over 
God in the sense that he withstands all of God’s harrowing and seemingly cruel 
tests.






![](/images/jahveh.jpg)




This scenario is 
particularly illustrative of Jung’s concept of 
*
[
individuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation)*, the 
journey towards self-actualization and the integration of 
different facets of the self into a coherent whole. Job's ordeal 
represents an extreme form of this process. Through facing 
extraordinary suffering and moral challenges, Job refines his 
identity, achieving a level of self-awareness and holistic 
consciousness that surpasses even God’s vast and ubiquitous 
light, thereby contributing a unique element to the divine 
narrative.**



Jung concludes that God, 'impressed' and perhaps 'enlightened' 
by Job's resilience and the depth of his individuation, then 
'decides' to incarnate as a 'Human.' This pivotal episode offers 
a symbolic foreshadowing of the coming of the *
[
Son of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_man_(Christianity))*, embodying the divine aspiration for 
individuation and wholeness within the human experience.




Therefore, the arrival of the Son 
of Man is prophesied through Job's ordeal. This story emphasizes 
the remarkable resilience and unyielding spirit of humankind. 
Faced with daunting adversities and suffering, Job upholds his 
faith and moral integrity, displaying a strength of character 
that commands divine respect and admiration.




Jung's interpretation suggests a 
moment of transformation for the divine: an acknowledgement of 
the value and complexity of human existence. Through Job's 
trials, God seems to gain a newfound 'understanding' of human 
resilience and spirit. The trials serve not merely as a test of 
faith, but as a profound exchange between human anguish and 
divine power. This reshapes the divine perspective, culminating 
in God's incarnation as a man in the figure of Jesus.



This narrative signifies a bridge between the boundless divine 
and the finite human condition, fostering a deeper and more 
empathetic connection between God and humanity, a theme perhaps 
more pronounced here than in other religious texts.



God 'longs' to become human, to experience life through our 
perspectives, to rejoice in existence alongside and within us.




What do I mean by 'God'?

**Let me elucidate my understanding of 'God' by referencing the wisdom of 
Meister Eckhart:




*"Heaven is pure and undisturbed clarity; 
unaffected by time and space;**
nothing bodily resides there, and it exists completely outside of time.

Its revolutions occur with incredible speed; its course itself is timeless,

yet from it, time emerges. Nothing hinders the soul from recognizing God

as much as time and space do, for time and space are always fragmented, but God 
is one. Thus, if the soul is to recognize God, it must do so

outside of time and beyond space, for God is neither this

nor that like the many things that exist there, but God is one."*

Meister Eckhart




God is the incomprehensible, primordial foundation 
transcending space-time. Consciousness acts as a conduit between this 
unfathomable, locationless primordial ground and space-time beings. When this 
higher-dimensional enigma manifests in our lower dimension, it transforms into 
the collective infinity of unlimited infinities. Here, a singular timeless 'now' 
metamorphoses into 'infinity.'




"God is creating the whole 
world now this instant."

Meister Eckhart




In the realm of God, there is no infinity. 
Infinity is space-time's impossible attempt to reach the in this sense divine 
zero through numbers.





"The happenings 
of a thousand years ago, days spent millenniums since,
are in eternity no 
further off than is this moment I am passing now;
the day to come a thousand 
years ahead or in as many years as you can
count, is no more distant in 
eternity than this very instant I am in."

[
Meister Ekchart](/western-mystics)




Consequently, consciousness manifests in time and 
space as a lattice of points, each point serving as a portal to a new fractal 
dimension within an immense cosmic hologram. From this perspective, God is 
perceived as an omnipresent, all-encompassing singularity, a unity that 
surpasses the fragmented reality of time and space. This reality, shaped by the 
same primordial foundation, continually unfolds into our existence in the very 
'now' of its emergence. In essence, the divine presence is not separate from our 
reality but intimately woven into its very fabric, constantly revealing itself 
in the timeless 'now'.



The Primordial Pan-Consciousness versus the Concentrated Light 
of Man

**Before Job's arrival, what was the nature of God? A 
primordial, non-self-aware pan-consciousness that both created 
and suffused time and space. This all-pervading consciousness is 
what I identify as God, who, at that 'time,' lacked 
self-awareness. The Indians would call it
[Brahman](/ouroboros/atman-job-son-of-shame).

This omnipresent 
pan-consciousness, though everywhere, did not possess 
self-awareness. The true journey began with the emergence of 
humans, endowed with the rare capacity for meta-awareness – the 
awareness of being aware. Inspired by Meister Eckhart, I 
interpret this as the first instance of consciousness reflecting 
back upon itself. To be blessed is to be cognizant of God:

*"I am certain **
as I live that nothing is so close to me as God.

God is nearer to me than I am to my own self;

my life depends upon God's being near me,

present in me.



So is he also in a stone, a log of wood,

only they do not know it.

If the wood knew of God and realized his nearness

like the highest of the angels does,

then the log would be as blessed as the chief of all angels."*

Meister Eckhart


In this context, the Son of God symbolizes the 
omnipresent light of God, focused and intensified within the narrow confines of 
the human brain. According to Meister Eckhart, the highest part of the soul and 
God’s essence are unified in this aspect:


*"To gauge the soul we must gauge it with God,

for the Ground of God and the Ground of the soul

are one and the same...The highest part

of the soul stands above time

and know nothing of time."

*Meister Eckhart




In this vein, a human being can be seen as a 
copied reflection of God, yet, paradoxically, this reflection surpasses the 
original in a specific sense: God achieves a higher level of Himself through His 
Son.


Hence, a human being can be viewed as a reflection 
of God, yet, paradoxically, this reflection surpasses the original in a certain 
respect: through His Son, God attains a higher level of Himself.



The phenomenon I refer to here is [
Ouroboros consciousness](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness). Only human consciousness can become aware of 
itself, and it is precisely in this self-reflection that God 'desires' to see 
Himself.



In this narrative, the copy transcends the original. Just as Job was greater 
than God, so is Christ greater, and so too can we be, when we come to enter the 
spiralling realm of self-awareness within a human brain. So there is no need to 
escape the simulation. The 'matrix' is a much more evolved place to be.



God is in Itself Cold and Vast

**Even when the primordial ground has manifested itself into a numerical 
infinity of infinities, it remains in essence 'cold' and mathematically 
impersonal. From this viewpoint, God's pan-consciousness regards us similarly to 
how we might observe an ant. This divine presence operates under a 'will' that 
is indifferent to individual predicaments: If one were to leap from a 
skyscraper, they would be destroyed by the laws of gravity, and this occurrence 
would transpire without any semblance of divine remorse or intervention.**


In this interpretation, God, as an overarching, all-encompassing entity, is not 
invested in the minutiae of individual lives. Instead, God's essence is woven 
into the fabric of the universe's fundamental laws and principles. Thus, the 
'coldness' of God refers to an absence of personal engagement with the 
individual aspects of the universe, adhering strictly to the unyielding laws 
that govern all existence.****


I have encountered individuals who have claimed that if I truly understood what 
enlightenment entailed, I would flee in terror. I am fairly certain that I would 
refuse the state they describe. From my perspective, this so-called 
enlightenment appears less human and more akin to a dissociative state, akin to 
losing one's identity in the same manner a cosmic black hole engulfs a star.



When an unprepared individual encounters the fractal, infinite consciousness 
within themselves, their delicate and precious human essence, akin to a 
flickering flame, can be easily snuffed out.



The aftermath of such an encounter is not enlightenment but an empty, 
depersonalized form of infinity. This state lacks the warmth and richness of 
human experience, leaving behind only a void where the vibrant tapestry of 
individual identity and consciousness once resided.



A person came to me and shared that in a profound state of depression, they had 
delved into their sorrow, becoming completely engulfed by it. On the other side 
of this sorrow was an infinite space filled with rainbows. However, being there 
felt cold. He couldn't find himsef anywhere and experienced an unsettling loss 
of identity. (Happily, this story ends with the person returning and becoming 
more whole.)



Another individual recounted how, during a two-day drinking binge, he was 
offered an LSD trip. For the following 14 days, he lay in bed, unable to do 
anything but exist in a vast void. After a month, he could echo the great sage 
Nisargadatta: 'There is joy, but there is no one who is joyful.' More often, 
anxiety and depression clouded the infinite sky within him. He could speak like 
a sage but were in a distressing state, devoid of his core personality. Two 
months later, those who knew him superficially noticed nothing unusual, but 
internally, his core essence had vanished. (This case story also has a happy 
ending.)



One of my friends, a psychiatrist, once told me: *'You have no idea how many 
Jesuses and Buddhas I have treated.'* (Personally, I believe that quite 
a few people who currently give satsangs or teach meditation belong to this 
category.)



One might argue that these versions of enlightenment, characterized by their 
impersonal nature, are precisely what is revered in Eastern traditions, where 
man achieves godliness in a state of utmost detachment. In my own experiences, I 
have met masters from this school of thought who hail dissociation and 
depersonalization as the epitome of true enlightenment.



Yet, the narrative shifts entirely when God becomes human. In this 
transformation, the essence of humanness—embodied in Love, Humility, and 
Humor—takes center stage. This shift emphasizes a different aspect of divinity, 
one that is deeply entwined with the human experience and values the richness of 
our human emotions and connections. In this perspective, enlightenment is not 
about transcending humanity but embracing and refining the qualities that make 
us fundamentally human.

*

Mr. Love, Humility, and Humor.*


[
Bhaharadwaj](meditator_sag_%20bharadwaj.htm) bid us farewell at his doorstep. We had a wonderful meeting with 
him. He extended his hands in blessing towards us and said several times with 
great love: *'May God bless you!'* 
Then, with a mischievous glance towards the sky, he added: *'May He bless me 
too!'* 


This small episode stands for me as the perfect 
embodiment of love, humility, and humor. The wise man's humor even had a 
delightful extra gift: humor in the form of self-irony!




The Small, Fragile, Imperfect, and Valuable Human

**The reason God desires to be Human, to be 'born' as the Son of Man, is that 
we, in all our fragility, self-importance, and imperfection, carry something 
incredibly valuable within us. Each one of us bears a small spark of love. Our 
concentrated little light is in reality the Prometheus torch that can ignite 
God's infinite lattice. Our small light of life can actually illuminate the 
entire infinity, much like a single matchstick can ignite an entire forest.**


God unexpectedly and uninvitedly knocks on an unknown door hidden somewhere in 
our heart. But we are often too busy with our meditative practices or external 
tasks to take this subtle knocking seriously.



In our ritualized and purposeful search for spiritual experiences, we might 
actually make it harder for God's wish to be fulfilled.

When two people are searching for each other in a big city, it's best if one of 
them stands still.


The Humanized Infinity

**The genuine meeting between God and Man is a union where infinity is 
humanized. From being a mathematically cold infinity, it now becomes a warm and 
living entity.


*God's exit is his entrance.**
He broke in to let us out.*

Eckhart


In this way, it is not so much God who enlightens 
man. Rather, it is Man who enlightens God. God's lattice, the universe's 
holographic and fractal infinity, is illuminated with human warmth in this 
encounter.


The Son of Man

**Although I don't hold much regard for the institutions of the Church, I 
must, somewhat against my will, conclude that no religious scripture comes 
closer to this truth than the New Testament. However, I interpret the Christ 
myth through the lens that led the great mystic Meister Eckhart to be condemned 
by the Inquisition. He said: 


*'What is true about Jesus Christ is true about 
**
every good and God-devoted person.'*


This means that YOU, dear reader, possess in your 
heart the way, the truth, and the life.



The dynamic yet fragile love of the Son and Daughter of Man is the fruit of an 
encounter between God and Man, where the love that each individual felt for 
everything dear to them has now fertilized the entire infinity. So now, the same 
individual feels a deep and living empathy for EVERYTHING. In this state, 
Infinity loves itself and with itself through Man.


*'If the doors of perception were cleansed,

everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.'

*William Blake

When God lives as the Son or Daughter 
of Man, everything remains as before, except for one thing. 
Everything is experienced and sensed from a Boundless, Infinite, 
and Magical perspective. The everyday life, which was once 
sleepily wrapped in eternal repetitions, is now experienced in 
its connectedness with the infinity of infinities with such awe, 
joy, and gratitude that it makes the hairs stand up all over the 
body of the fortunate winner in God’s lottery.

*'The joy and satisfaction of it 
are ineffable.

It is like a horse turned loose in a lush meadow, giving vent to 
his

horse-nature by galloping full-tilt about the field:

he enjoys it, and it is his nature.'*

Eckhart




THE GRAND TRANSLATOR****

** It is a very simple psychological mechanism that determines whether 
something seems real or not. For those who love following the British royal 
wedding on TV, the royal world is real. For others who are not interested in the 
regal spectacle, it is mere fantasy. It is our heart that determines what is 
real. Where our heart is, there is 'reality.' What our heart loves becomes real. 
If the Heart forms a bond with the body, the senses, and the physical world, 
then the world in time and space is real.**


The Heart Grants Reality****
The Heart gives reality to what it loves. Thus, seeing the world as an illusion 
is the same as saying one is not attached to it.



The crucial question now is: What does the heart love? I personally love the 
story of the Son of Man.



How I discovered the Grand Translator

**Let me share a story with you. About ten years ago, I found myself in an 
unexpected situation one morning in a hotel in a foreign country, just before 
checking out and catching a train to the capital city. By a series of highly 
improbable coincidences, which is a story in itself, I mistakenly ingested 10 
doses of LSD with my morning coffee.**


Merely minutes after hastily drinking my coffee, as I was rushing to check out, 
I realized that an extraordinary experience was imminent. It felt as though a 
freight train from another dimension had collided with me, and my window of 
opportunity to act rationally in this world was rapidly narrowing. I managed to 
get to the hotel reception in the nick of time and extended my stay for another 
day. During this process, I felt like I was entering my Visa card PIN in several 
parallel universes simultaneously.


*Nature is ruthless, brutal, unforgiving, and 
beautiful

in ways incompatible with our tidy human minds.

*[
Statement made by AI GPT-3](https://twitter.com/bygpt3)


In the elevator to my room, my body 
seemed unoccupied by what I had known as 'myself' just moments earlier. Yet, 
this entity, whatever it was, knew my room number. The next thing I remember is 
lying on my bed, gazing into infinity with countless eyes.



In that state, there was no room for fear, for there was no 'one' there to feel 
it. The ego had dissolved under the potent influence of the LSD, without even a 
moment to muster any resistance. It was like death had swung its scythe so 
swiftly and unexpectedly that there was no time left for any negotiation.



The subsequent five hours are both difficult to remember and to describe. When 
there is no distinct observer, only the observed folding into itself, how can 
one articulate or recall anything meaningful? What I experienced was akin to an 
immense clockwork, governed solely by an infinite interplay of mathematical 
algorithms and geometry. This clockwork constantly transformed, taking on 
ever-new shapes marked by colorful fractals and kaleidoscopic visions. These 
patterns were felt in every cell of a body as vast as the algorithms coursing 
through it.



An equation for me has no meaning

unless it expresses a thought of God


Ramanujan


In this vast ocean of endlessly 
morphing interactions of infinite, nameless forms, there was synesthetic 
sensing, observing, and self-awareness without doubt, will, second thoughts, 
reflections, or hesitation. A thousand-stringed orchestra of 
sound-color-feelings played with an inhuman certainty, even though every note 
from this psychedelic ensemble—from the deepest sub-sonic bass pipes controlled 
by foot to the highest frequencies—was entirely new and never before played. It 
was simultaneously extraordinarily beautiful and inhuman. This concert was me 
yet not for me, simultaneously being a part of me but indifferent to my 
existence or any other living entity, treating everything as an insignificant 
byproduct of clashing mathematical algorithms interacting with each other like 
soldiers indifferent to their own survival.



If I had been present as myself, the relentless grinding of the space-time 
wheels would have been a source of terror. But I wasn't there, and the machine 
itself was certainly indifferent to its own acts of creation and destruction.




![](/images/tapet281.jpg)


Around 5 to 8 hours later, as judged 
by the fact that it wasn't yet dark, a call from my bladder brought just enough 
of 'me' back to life to navigate to the bathroom, much like the rest of the 
divine machinery was functioning automatically.



Returning to the bed after this small physical action, a faint sense of self 
re-emerged, just enough for me to decide to listen to some beautifully modulated 
music. This task proved challenging, but eventually, I managed to play one of my 
playlists. It was my extensive collection of Rachmaninoff's works. (Was this a 
mere coincidence? Today, I think not.)



Rachmaninoff's complex and late-romantic compositions awakened within me a 
little 2-year-old child, a child that 'innerstood' every note in the music. This 
little child felt defenseless, frightened, and insecure, as if it had fallen 
into a river of sounds, teetering on the brink of annihilation with each new 
twist of Rachmaninoff's incredible finger-magic.



As I sit here now, a mature adult sipping morning coffee on my sofa, I write to 
articulate what the child within experienced but could not verbalize at the 
time. Rachmaninoff’s compositions, standing on a razor's edge, pushed rhythms, 
harmonies, and melodies to the brink of self-destruction, a characteristic often 
heard in classical music of and following his era. Yet, Rachmaninoff, still an 
old romantic at heart, adhered to the ideals of Kalos, Kai, Agathos—truth, 
beauty, and goodness. Thus, his wild musical escapades always found salvation at 
the last second in beautiful cadenzas, leading to new exhilarating orchestral 
journeys.



The child within was just trying to keep its head above water in this tumultuous 
river of Rachmaninoff's creation. Slowly, it began to realize that it was being 
saved again and again. A budding sense of trust emerged, gradually transforming 
into tears of gratitude. This feeling of safety amidst the storm grew stronger 
and more profound. I believe the child wept for hours. And then, suddenly, it 
happened. The heart opened up.



The Heart is the Grand Translator

**By 'the heart,' I refer to something within the entire chest area that 
encompasses the lungs as well. The previously mentioned impersonal, algorithmic 
infinity of infinities was still operating at full capacity, but now a 
fundamental shift had occurred.**


This force entered my body through the chest area, and there, the same cold 
clockwork was transformed into a fireworks display of human emotions. There were 
cascades of the most exquisite feelings in every color of the rainbow and 
beyond—fragile yet immensely powerful. During this transformation, the child 
aged and gained wisdom, understanding why God loves humanity and desires to 
live, translated into human form, within a living, vulnerable heart.



The heart, then, is the Grand Translator. It functions like a stargate, a portal 
where every fragment of the frozen god of algorithms can find warmth at the 
fireplace.



Through the human heart, God translates Himself into human form.

Here the infinite becomes intimate.



Therefore, the fragmented and fragile human heart is the greatest entity in the 
universe. The greater the suffering this heart has endured, the greater its 
mature capacity to experience extreme states of love in as many ways as there 
are particles in the universe. The more we have suffered, the more God longs to 
enter our chest, to sing and dance in the cracks and scars we have all, more or 
less, accumulated in His honor. This is why Meister Eckhart posits that next to 
God, there is nothing more noble than human suffering.
