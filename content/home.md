MEDITATION.DK MANIFESTO**



![](/images/blaa.jpg)


*What is taken in by contemplation **
must be given out in love*

[Meister Eckhart](/western-mystics#Meister Eckhart 1260-1328)




Hello, out there! Let me state my position**


*To call a man enlightened as we sometimes do, means little.**
*[Meister Eckhart](/western-mystics)



I am not a guru. [ I am not 'enlightened'](/what-is-meditation#I_am_not_Enlightened_).



I am not interested in 
organized teaching 
spirituality or meditation. I have no commercial interest in this website.




My goal is, as far as I know myself, to inspire and be inspired.




I have been doing all kinds of spiritual practices continuously for almost 50 
years now. I lived in India for more than seven years in search of 
['spiritual software'](/spiritual-inspirators). 
Now at the tender age of 70, I feel better, stronger, and happier than ever 
before.




What is mine, belongs to you.



As a natural extension of this, I offer free guidance on meditation, not as a 
teacher, but as a tour guide.
I was a tour guide in the Far East for ten years. Time and again, I led groups 
to the Taj Mahal.
But I do not claim the Taj Mahal as mine.



This is not a school. There are no levels in which you can become a PHD in 
spirituaity. No methods to buy. What I offer is 
lived experience, shared freely. If it resonates, take what you need. If not, 
find your cloud. It’s all part of the same sky.



You’re welcome to reach out: [gunnars@mail.com](mailto:gunnars@mail.com)



Meditation.dk is read by only a select few.

**And that’s perfectly fine. Because in my search for truth, I don’t rely on 
hyperbole or clickbait to attract attention.**
You won’t find headlines here like* 'You’ve Been Lied To!'* or *'Banned 
Interview Revealed!'* This is the kind that sell tickets to the social media freak 
show.



Truth doesn’t shout. It rarely entertains. And more often than not, it’s quiet, 
humble, and sometimes even boring.



It doesn’t sell itself.

It asks something of you.

It requires stillness, honesty, and the active energy to listen.



How to Read Meditatation.dk

**Meditation.dk can be approached in two distinct but complementary ways. For 
some, it unfolds best through a linear path, starting with the chapter 
Consciousness & Evolution and progressing step by step in a coherent, logical 
flow. Others may prefer a nonlinear journey, following internal links that loop 
across themes, allowing [intuition](/ouroboros/new-ouroboic-intelligence) to 
guide the exploration. Both approaches are valid. The site is designed to 
support both structured understanding and spontaneous insight, reason and 
intuition in dialogue. In this way, Meditation.dk becomes not just something to 
read. It is
[
a mirror](/consciousness/between-nothing-and-something#The_living_Mirror_of_Emptiness_) for the way consciousness itself moves:
[spiraling,](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness) reflective, and poetic.**


The Importance of Repetition

**[What is meditation](/what-is-meditation)? With an open mind, it is the act of feeling, seeing, and 
reflecting inwardly with the same passionate persistence that one possesses 
after mastering a musical instrument over many years. **



In the writings here on Meditation.dk, it is essential 
upfront to clarify a 
key aspect:
[the deliberate use of 
repetition](/what-is-meditation#Meditation_is_Massage_-_Massage_is_Embodied_Message_). I often repeat assertions as though they were mantras. This approach 
distinguishes this work from an academic one, where knowledge is often treated 
as a linear event, grasped once, cataloged, and swiftly left behind.




I remember, as a young university student, being frustrated by the spiritual 
literature of India. Why did the sages keep saying the same things over and 
over, almost to the point of irritation? Now, I understand. And I try to strike a 
balance here: between what I would call emotionally motivated redundancy and 
academic progression.


Repetition is revelation. It is the slow unveiling of deeper layers: of
[sensation, emotion, and subtle knowing](/fields/meditative-pixelation). 
On Meditation.dk, the writing unfolds in a genre that lives somewhere between 
music and philosophy; between the mantric repetition of a chorus line and the 
academic impulse to arrive at a conclusion.



Each return to the same phrase, the same truth, the same image, is like another 
turn of the gem beneath the light. New angles gleam. New facets emerge. 
Repetition uncovers layers: of sensation, of emotion, of silent knowing. It 
slows the mind down just enough to let integration begin.



The intellect, by nature, is impatient. It moves on the moment it believes it 
has 'understood' something, often leaving insight only half-digested. But 
meditative 'innerstanding' grows in spirals, not straight lines.


*Philosophers are indeed wise 
enough, but they lack wisdom.

*Yoka Daishi






*'Innerstanding' *versus* 'Understanding'*

**Genuine 
comprehension, however; what the Danish mystic [Sunyata](/inspirators/sunyata) 
call *'innerstanding'*, follows a different 
trajectory. It is not linear but vertical, delving deeper in spirals with each iteration. 
This path of innerstanding requires persistence, presence, and a willingness to 
revisit the same truths until they sink into the core of our being. We 
transition from knowledge to wisdom through dynamic repetition.**


*The Meaning of Mantra

*The repetition of spiritual insights is akin to massaging a tense muscle. A 
single push on the muscle is not enough to release its tension. Only through 
repeated, consistent effortless effort does the 
resistance of both the mind and the muscle gradually dissolve, allowing a more 
profound change to take place.



This is the broader meaning of mantra: a tool for creating resonance and harmony, 
not just through sound but also through repetition in thought and intention. 
Each repetition deepens the imprint on our consciousness, moving us closer to a 
state where wisdom becomes embodied rather than merely conceptual.



Repetition is here not about rote memorization or intellectual stubbornness. It is 
about cultivating a rhythm of engagement that aligns with the natural processes 
of growth and transformation. Nature is all about repetitions. Just as a seed requires repeated watering and 
sunlight to grow, so too do the seeds of innerstanding require the steady 
nourishment of mindful and passionate repetition.



Looping Liquid Love****
We’ve all felt it. Repetition can be dull.

Sisyphus knew that. So did Kierkegaard.



But we also repeat what we love.



Love is the great attractor, drawing us back again and again.



Without love, repetition is a curse.



Within love, it becomes a dynamic force of longing. It becomes a looping rhythm where 
understanding deepens into innerstanding, and innerstanding ripens into lived 
wisdom.



There are thousands of meditation techniques, philosophies, and systems.

What makes them come alive or fall flat?



Love does.



Every idea, system, or technique only truly works when it becomes a vessel for 
something more essential than itself.
Only within love’s liquid loops do these forms become alive.



The Frozen Past and the Living Moment

**Religions, sects, and spiritual authorities still march with the feudal 
herds of the past. But that age is dissolving, faster than ever, because our time 
has become more liquid than ever. A new era is arriving, shaped by accelerating 
rhythms, shifting at a speed unlike anything witnessed before in human history.**


In this ever-morphing scenario, one thing becomes clear:

If we blindly follow the old paths, even those paved just yesterday, we lose the 
ability to ride the waves of the soul.



Now it is up to us to shape the framework through which meditation breathes 
within us. The responsibility has shifted: each of us must craft our own 
spiritual interface.



And in this freedom, we must be vigilant, courageous, and above all remember 
this sutra:
What was true yesterday may no longer be true today.

A New Spiritual Architechture

**In this emerging landscape, more like an ocean, we’re invited to draw upon the 
wisdom of great thinkers, mystics, and traditions from every time and corner of 
the world. And in turn, we become living sources of inspiration for others.**


To build our new inner cathedral, we gather rubble from ancient temples, 
mosques, and places of worship worldwide. Every culture, from the dawn of 
civilization, carries a spark of timeless wisdom. The new tree of wisdom roots 
itself in all that came before us.



Meditation in the Dance between Individuality and Collectivity

**As free individuals, we carve our own paths: Yet here we are always in a conscious and 
respectful dance with the world around us and the world that was before us.**


If we follow only our own impulses blindly, we lose our balance.



Just look at 
Trump. Or Musk.



Expanded consciousness always includes the other’s perspective, because true 
awakening means becoming the other, not from the outside,
[but from within](/fields/spheric-eversion).



First, you merge with one person.

Then with the group.

Then with another culture, another country, the planet itself.



And at the far end of the rainbow, a shockingly beautiful realization awaits:



There is only one observer in all of creation.



Fractal Individuaity

**This reflects the logic of fractal repetition: patterns that echo across all 
scales, from the iris of the eye to the branching of trees to the spiraling of 
galaxies. In this sense, we are all expressions of a single being, a shared 
observer.**
And yet, within this unity, subtle variations arise, each one essential.



To fulfill our role in the greater cosmic design, it is just as vital to honor 
our small, individual differences as it is to embody what unites us all.



So we journey both alone and together, each on a distinct path, yet woven into a 
larger tapestry of shared becoming.
And for this, we need free communities. We should not be governed by guru-power or economics, but 
be rooted in mutual respect and conscious presence.




In such communities, we become each other’s teachers, joined by friendship and 
an openness of heart.





They resemble flocks of migrating birds: no fixed leader, only a shifting flow 
of shared intelligence; guiding, adjusting, responding. We are each individually 
contributing to the harmony of the whole.




In a living group, some individuals may know more than others, and they share 
that knowledge freely. Because knowledge belongs to no one in particular. Its 
nature is to flow freely, only the ego hoards it, clinging to it in the vain hope 
of glory or profit.



Indeed, once you dwell in the heart of all things, the longing for external 
power fades away. As Meister Eckhart beautifully expressed:


*
To one who even for an instant has seen into this ground,

a thousand ducats of red beaten gold

are worth no more than a false
[farthing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farthing_(English_coin)).

*
[Meister Eckhart](/western-mystics)



The Age of Gurus and Religious Institutions 
is Fading.

**Despite the iconic image of hermits and Himalayan cave dwellers, the 
cultivation of consciousness has always been a collective endeavor.**
Without surrounding cultures that respected and upheld meditative solitude, 
there would have been no yogis disappearing into caves for decades, no Christian 
or Buddhist ascetics retreating into lives of renunciation. Much good came from 
these traditions and institutions.




But religious and spiritual institutions, though often born of noble 
intentions, have also served as political power structures.

Within their vertical hierarchies, the trade-off for social order and spiritual 
infrastructure has too often led to top-down depersonalization.

In today’s world, this no longer resonates with the self-aware, self-authoring 
individual.




We can no longer access the sacred within the confines of rigid hierarchies.

We’ve become too individual, too self-defined, for that model to hold.




But this triumph of individuality now reveals its shadow.

The blessing of selfhood, in an age of accelerating change, teeters on the edge 
of a curse.



Let me repeat the not so secret mantra of our time:

Look at Trump. Look at Musk.



This gift of individuality must evolve - not backwards into conformity,

but forward into a higher form of collectivity: one that honors both the 
uniqueness of the individual and the intelligence of the whole.



*
First go the Bukowski-way - but not all the Way***




I am deeply inspired by Bukowski's poem displayd 
in the above youtube video.
Before anything else, we must stand upright in our own fire-pillar of life. That 
takes courage, real courage. **


And on this path, there are real challenges.



The first step in meditation often requires a surprising act of egoism, sometimes 
even a homeopathic dose of narcissism. At least that was true for me. I had to 
start over, taking baby steps to learn how to listen to my own feelings, rather 
than shaping my actions to please those around me. My inner truth became 
paramount, even at the cost of disappointing others.



Before we can reunite with all of life within ourselves, we must first discover 
and inhabit the small, hidden corners that make us different. In this phase, we 
must dare to love, perhaps even worship, our own weirdness, even if it means 
walking in solitude.



Where our individuality rubs up against collective norms, we must resist the 
subtle violence of self-erasure. We must not cut a heel or clip a toe just to 
fit into someone else’s mold.



Instead, with vigilance and conscious awareness, a new synthesis will 
emerge, between you and me, between them and us.



But that requires the dying of old ways.



Let me say it again, consciously, deliberately: Everything is changing, faster 
than ever. We live in a global world shaped by big data and constant rupture. 
The old frameworks of religion, and even much of New Age spirituality, are now 
obsolete. They played their part in humanity’s evolution, but riding today’s 
tsunami of transformation demands something new: a liquid, independent, and 
fiercely awake state of consciousness.



From that fearless and unexpected vantage, I gentlyan, d lovingly, bid farewell to 
the spiritual teachers of the past. They still nourish me, even the ones I later 
realized were false. But I am no longer their follower.



To my surprise and delight, I find I’m not surfing this wave alone.



I don’t want to end up like a Bukowski, alone, bitter, and drunk on defiance.



So I stopped gazing upward for a leader to show me the way. Instead, I looked 
around - and inward. And there, horizontally, I discovered kindred spirits.



I am not alone here. Within me lives the observer,
[a 
spheric eversive consciousness](/fields/spheric-eversion) that dwells in every being.



The Rise of Shared Fields of Consciousness

**When we are free and independent, only then it is time to reach out and share in 
cloud-like relationships with kindred souls around us. We can inspire each other 
in spiritual information circuits where up and down, in and out, back and forth 
changes all the time in a state of flux. Here we are all each other's gurus and 
devotees. We exchange spiritual information in a way similar to open source 
technology. In this open field, we enter a collective and ampified field of 
shared consciousness. **


The collective cloud of super-consciousness is however, not for everybody - yet.




The unfoldment of the collective cloud consciousness can be compared to the 
evolution of the Athenian democracy. The Athenian democracy was not for 
everybody. It was only a privilege for the citizens of the city-state. The masses 
had to wait nearly 2,000 years before the gates were opened and they were included in the 
club.



My guess is that there are several newly formed democratic fields of 
spirituality all over the globe by now. Each of them has a distinct rainbow 
color and 'mission'. But I’m talking about those evolving without financial 
exchange. At this stage of our civilization, information—and especially 
spiritual insight, wants to flow freely, untainted by commodification.



Just look at social media: when information is turned into a commodity, it 
becomes distorted, sensationalized, and stripped of integrity. And spiritual 
information, being far more subtle, suffers even more.




Are you a Chosen One?

**So how do you know if *you* are the Chosen One, evolutionarily ready and 
eligible to be part of a new, quietly exclusive brother- and sisterhood?**


Simple:

A true club of consciousness will never exclude you.



You will exclude yourself - by your lack of interest.



Meister Eckhart says:


*Whoso is unable to follow this discourse, let him never mind.

While he is not like this truth he shall not see my argument.*


But I’m not only speaking of my 'club.'

My words may not spark anything in you, and that’s fine.

You might feel drawn to another cloud with a different signature.

It’s all part of the same sky.





Meditation & the Noble Soul****
The reason meditation is so hard to understand is precisely its simplicity.

For a noble and innocent soul, there is nothing to understand, only something to 
'innerstand'. Everything reveals itself intuitively, not as knowledge, but as wisdom.



In these dazzlingly clever times, most of us have lost touch with what it means 
to be noble. Wise. Not performatively, but quietly, deeply, and truly.



So do yourself a favor. Watch the video below. It features 
[Bhaharadwaj,](meditator_sag_%20bharadwaj.htm) who just turned 97, sharing his 
noble wisdom without a trace of self-importance.







And below, you’ll meet another noble soul: my friend
[Shabdanand](/inspirators/shabdanand).

When this video was recorded in 1995, he was 80 years old.








To those who take the time to watch:

Have you seen such people in the West?

I haven’t.



It’s as if old age - so often feared - is actually the perfect season for a final 
spiritual blossoming. But that blossoming only comes in those who’ve nurtured 
the soil of their being across a lifetime.



Those who meditate for egocentric reasons will, in time, drift away.

My guess? Many of the young, social media-savvy influencers preaching meditation 
today will not be meditating themselves in ten years.


It may sound old-fashioned, but only a 
noble personality can meditate consistently through a whole life.



Even in times of hyperchange, some things do not change. The center of the 
cyclone is still still. And when it comes to the inner workings of man, that stillness 
has a name: 


*Nobility*


I do not belong to the club of meditation experts who make a living by telling 
people that meditation is for everyone. I can afford to tell the truth as I see 
it:




The truth does not sell tickets. The more something is for sale, the less truth 
it contains.



**
Therefore a life in what I would call true 
Meditation is reserved for the few.



However, it for me seems that these few are growing in number!



And out of this reason alone I must confess:



I love the time we live in. 


The dancing star is born in 
chaos.
