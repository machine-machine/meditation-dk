PART I - THE SUPER AWAKE FLOW**


*I have never worked a day in my 
life. It was all fun.**
*Thomas A. Edison



*Let the beauty we love be what we do.

*Rumi


*My master has revealed to me

The mirror within my own body;

Now I'll sing and dance in ecstasy.

*Mirabai

Shakespeare, through Hamlet, posed 
an essential existential query: 


*"To be or not to be"

*

Acknowledging the profundity of this question, I propose a 
complementary one:



"To surf or not to surf"



Do you stand on your surfboard or not?
Flow is the essence of life. It's 
experienced when we engage in activities that resonate with our 
purpose, yet with joyous ease. First we have to *be* in a 
state of glow. Then we have to surf in a state of flow.



My hope is that Meditation.dk can inspire you, not to become a 
monk, but to be a playful surfer on the ever-changing 
currents of your life.



Traditional eastern meditation philosophy suggests the world is empty, 
impermanent, an illusion, and advises disengagement due to its 
constant change. In the sarch for this state the ego becomes the 
enemy.



I offer a different perspective: Why not surf 
the waves of life? Why not be a friend of the ego?



Sure your life is not permanent, but your surf can be more 
permanent than the waves themselves, which last mere seconds.



You have the potential to stand on your surfboard for a 
lifetime.



To achieve this life in flow, you need to strike a balance within yourself, 
navigating between engagement with the world and disengagement 
in meditation, balancing introspective practices with active 
participation in life's vibrant flow.



If you're overly absorbed in your external life, you'll fall off 
your surfboard. A stressed person cannot surfe in joyous ease. 
On the other hand, if you retreat into prolonged meditation, you 
might become so disengaged from life that you fall out of the 
flow zone. I heard about a man who went to an intensive 
meditation retreat. When he came back from the retreat he could 
not find the love he previously had for his children.



The ancient Indians had valid reasons for perceiving the world 
as an illusion, living in times of uncertainty with constant 
threats of war and drought. In our more stable era, it may be 
more beneficial to view life as real.



The Heart Points out Reality

**What determines the reality of phenomena? It is your heart. What 
your heart engages with becomes real. In its absence, a sense of 
unreality prevails.**


If you do not love something it will not bloom.

If you do love it too much and with attachment, it will be taken 
away from you.



The essence of true surfing lies in navigating the golden middle 
path along life’s river.

The Surfing Buddha

**In our modern lives, many of us are overly immersed in the outer 
world's circus, and thus, a dose of meditation can be essential 
to find the sweet spot where we are in a state of creation. **


Deep relaxation in powerful action. This is the way of the 
surfing Buddha.

The Intro-version of Holger the Dane

**The [
legend of *Holger the Dane*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogier_the_Dane) 
depicts a hero in a deep, trance-like sleep, ready to awaken and 
defend Denmark should the nation face grave danger. As a Danish 
child, I grew up with this story, never imagining that my 
history teacher's enthusiastic retellings would later 
crystallize into a compelling metaphor for the phenomenon of 
flow. My teacher was for sure *
[in the zone](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_the_zone)
*when he narrated this tale. Otherwise I would not have 
remembered it.



![](/images/holgerdanske.jpg)

**
Holger the 
Dane in Kronborg, Helsing&oslash;r, Denmark 


This is how I interpret the story 
today: Although Holger seems to be asleep 
for years, he is actually in a meditative state filled with 
inner peace, heightened awareness, and latent potential. His 
sudden awakening serves as a vivid emblem for transitioning from 
this contemplative state, primed to face challenges with clarity 
and purpose. Just as Holger's dormant strength bursts forth to 
safeguard Denmark, so too can a meditator's inner tranquility 
transform into a dynamic outward flow of creativity and energy.



![](/images/holgerwarrior.jpg)


An Indian tourist, deeply 
knowledgeable in his own spiritual traditions, might view Holger 
in his Kronborg cellar through a similar unique lens that I 
acquired during my formative years spent with Indian saints. 
According to ancient Indian philosophy, Holger's trance-like 
meditation could be seen as an intense accumulation of spiritual 
energy or *[Shakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakti)*, the 
potency of which grows with the length and depth of his 
meditation.



Unlike a yogi, who would keep this energy internalized to 
elevate his spiritual prowess, Holger's intended use of this 
amassed energy is intriguing. The yogi seeks to accumulate and 
retain this energy, reaching a state of desirelessness and 
consequently becoming more powerful than even the gods, 
according to the adage, *There is nothing the gods fear more 
than a man who does not want anything*. This state of 
desirelessness acts as a crucible for immense spiritual energy, 
which purifies the yogi and bestows upon him various powers, or
*[siddhis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhi)*, 
from clairvoyance to healing abilities.




Holger's meditation serves a different purpose. Rather than 
retaining this energy for self-purification or attainment of 
divine abilities, he is poised to channel it outward in a moment 
of national crisis. In this sense, both Holger and the yogi 
touch upon what can be termed as *zero*,
[*shoonya*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Śūnyatā)—a metaphysical state of 
pure empty potential where all dualities dissolve into a unified 
consciousness. While the yogi remains in this state, 
transcending divine limitations and becoming an "almighty 
version" of everything, Holger emerges from it with a very 
earthly and nationalistic purpose: the defense of Denmark.




The absence of Flow in the Indian Traditions

**A paradox here is that, 
particularly in Indian mystical traditions, 
the creative outcome of meditation, has not received much attention. 
Historically, these 
traditions has often extolled depersonalization and passivity, 
viewing the physical world as an illusion, or '[*maya*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion))'. 
While India is abundant with anecdotal tales of miracles 
following the path of saints, there's seldom a direct connection 
made between meditation and down to earth practical, worldly activities. 
**


The Indians have typically seen the phenomenon of spiritual joy 
as an internal experience, not connected to their work. In the 
philosophy of *
[karma-yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_yoga)*, 
the yoga of action, practitioners disengage and disidentify with 
what they do, focusing all attention on God. Hence, emphasizing 
the outpouring creativity in a state of joy as a result of 
meditation introduces a novel facet in the evolutionary 
progression of this art, at least within the context of the 
ancient Indian tradition.



In India, Holger still sits and accumulate spiritual energy in a 
cave in the Himalayas.



The flow of the Budai

**However, we must not overlook China's influence. When Indian 
spirituality, in the form of Buddhism, reached China during the
[Han period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty), 
the concept of maya was cast aside. The Chinese civilization was 
too firmly rooted in Taoistic engagement with ordinary 
day-to-day life. Taoism highlighted the flow state or *
[Wu 
Wei,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei)* and through the subsequent intermingling with 
Buddhism, Taoism reshaped Chinese Buddhism in the spirit of the 
effortless action of flow. The slender Buddha from India 
transformed into the jolly and robust
[Chinese Budai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budai).



![](/images/budaisurfing.jpg)

**
*Be careful not to mix up Bodai with a 
Californian surfer.

Bodai, first and foremost, serves the state, a state as

intrinsic and potent as the ocean's waves.*


While the Chinese concept of 
*wu-wei* was perceived as an ethos of public service, 
embodying a frictionless, "do nothing" state of being in the 
world and human society, the modern Western concept of flow 
emphasizes personal success above all. In short, the Chinese Confucian flow-individual served the 
state, with the promise of food in abundance while in the contemporary West, the state serves the 
individual in his self improvement. This individualism is, in my eyes, a great blessing, 
but no great thing comes without a corresponding challenge or 
curse.



Emergence of New Hybrid Movements

**Though Holger seems serious, my 
experience suggests that meditation often nurtures one's playful 
sides. Being in a flow state requires a relaxed, humorous 
baseline, offering fertile ground for our inner child's 
spontaneous ideas and playfulness.


For me, the tale of Holger the 
Dane serves as a compelling example that introspection and flow 
are both timeless universals and reflections of their specific 
times. While the Vikings undoubtedly experienced a form of flow, 
it was distinct from the kind of flow that the hippies of the 
'70s danced to while chanting *Make love, not war*. Thus, 
the flow I am about to explore is not of the berserk variety. It 
has been shaped by my unique experiences, especially my 
engagement with Indian meditation movements since the 1970s.**


It's not coincidental that the concept of flow was articulated 
not by an Indian saint but by
[
a western psychologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) in 1970. In today's world, we are all 
hybrid beings, and my understanding of flow reflects this 
multifaceted reality. Like rivers that flow into the ocean, flow 
is both a universal phenomenon and one that is shaped by its 
specific context.


In this context, it is significant to note that the 
progressive hybrid meditation movements of the 20th century 
originated in India, not China. Beginning with the
[
Theosophical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophical_Society), these movements embarked on a journey 
to explore the potential of meditation to effect tangible, 
positive changes in the world.
[
Transcendental Meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation), which rose to prominence in the 
late 
1960s, and
[Osho's 
movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneesh_movement), which gained traction in the 1980s, stand out 
among the most influential of these groups. They adopted an 
innovative perspective, one that sought to channel the 
transformative power of meditation towards personal growth and 
global betterment. While I do not necessarily advocate following 
these or other specific movements, I acknowledge a debt to them 
for their innovative perspectives.



In the modern era, meditation's connection with the concept of 
flow has become nearly universally accepted, showcasing a 
profound intersection between ancient practice and contemporary 
understanding. In the same hybrid spirit I have allowed myself 
to transition from one cultural or philosophical context to 
another quite rapidly.



Significantly, there has been a surge of scientific research 
documenting the state of flow and outlining methods to achieve 
it. From my perspective, it appears that in America, this 
concept of flow has been co-opted by a pervasive drive for 
self-optimization, fueled by a societal fear of failure — a 
legitimate concern in the 'Yes! You can do it!' culture.



In contrast, my upbringing in Scandinavian society, with its 
robust social safety net, instilled a less intense fear of 
failure. Here, failures are cushioned, preventing the kind of 
destitution seen among the homeless in California. Consequently, 
my ideal of flow leans towards a more relaxed approach, 
reminiscent of the easygoing Indian rickshaw drivers who, 
despite poverty, always find time for a smile. Their attitude is 
truly admirable!



Why did the Indian, rather than the Chinese tradition of 
spirituality, come to dominate the West? My conjecture is that 
it relates to the anarchistic and fractal chaos inherent in 
Indian culture. In India, there was never a central figure like 
a pope who could concentrate and monopolize spiritual 
storytelling. Consequently, India possesses a myriad of 
different spiritual traditions, reflected in their overwhelming 
number of 
gods. This cultural approach aligns perfectly with the Western 
focus on individualism. With so many gods to chose from, 'I' can 
be god too.



MEDITATIVE GLOW & FLOW

**Isn't it fascinating that during the quiet act of sitting in 
stillness, unprovoked and inexplicable waves of happiness often 
seem to 
emerge? Meditation happens in a state of internal glow that 
could be described as a feeling of purposeless purpose. In this 
luminous dark space, we embody meaning rather than perform it. 
This state of grace occurs spontaneously, here and now, in a 
state of will-less surrender, accompanied by an inexplicable joy 
and interoceptive well-being.**


The esteemed mystic, [
Emanuel S&oslash;rensen](/inspirators/sunyata), beautifully labeled this divine 
offering as a state of joyous ease, while the Indians 
encapsulate this unique state of self-absorption and desireless 
existence as *
[ananda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ānanda_(Hindu_philosophy))* 
or *[
sat-chit-ananda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satcitananda).* 




To experience even a fragment of that glow can be life changing.




![](/images/tommedi.jpg)


*Immersed in the Glow*


After-Glow comes Flow****
This divine gift, first encountered during meditation, gradually 
seeps into our everyday activities, provoking a spontaneous, 
creative flow. This almost magical transformation from 
luminosity to fluidity is one of the most delectable fruits 
yielded by a life committed to the art of meditation. 


The journey begins with an
[
interoceptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoception) encounter with causeless, blissful glow. This 
luminosity transforms into flow when the non-doing '*ananda*' 
state overflows into creative action. 
Actions emanating from this state 
are as effortless and thought-less as the meditative state 
itself. Inner passivity in attention gives rise to spontaneous 
outer activity. Inactivity within oneself thus fosters 
spontaneous creative action in the external world.


But seek ye 
first the kingdom of God, 
and his righteousness;

and all these things shall be added unto 
you.


[
Jesus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew 6:33&version=KJV)


Thus the kingdom of divine 
potentiality should be our prime pursuit. 
Let me sum up with a little 
rewriting of a famous Nietzsche quote: One must have silence in 
oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.




![](/images/tommedi5.jpg)


*And now** in the 
Flow*


You cannot bodybuild the Soul
**


*He who seeks God in some way (read meditation technique 
or ritual),**
grasps the way and loses God, who dwells in the way. But he who seeks 
God without a way, grasps God and lives with the Son.*

[Meister Eckhart](/western-mystics#Meister Eckhart 1260-1328)




As with many life phenomena, this meditative glow-flow can't 
be grasped through sheer willpower. After all, the soul's 
strength cannot be cultivated like bodily muscles. Deep 
meditation can't arise from ego-driven willpower; you can tense 
your muscles through sheer force of will, but you can't relax 
them using the same method. This is a key challenge for Western, 
success-oriented cultures when it comes to embracing meditation. 
It is difficult for a Jane Fonda *no pain - no gain* 
mindset to understand that we can achieve anything by not doing 
anything.




We should *be* meditation rather than merely *do* meditation.



When we transition from human-doings to human-beings, we become *meditated* 
rather than actively meditating.



So, to reiterate: meditation is not a practice or a routine. It 
is pure, effortless creativity that blossoms the moment we 
relinquish the act of 'doing' meditation.


For this reason, meditation cannot 
rely solely on methods, techniques, or exercises. The paradox 
lies in the fact that any deliberate intention to meditate moves 
us away from the state of meditation itself.



If you have anything other 
than a playful easy going relationship with meditative techniques or 
exercises, well, my site may not be for you... or perhaps 
exactly for you...

I have 
personally observed [Papaji](papaji_and_meditation.htm) escorting guests out

of his home when they attempted to assume

rigid meditation postures in his presence.


Nurturing Meditative Flow in Vulnerability

**So how can we nurture this joyous ease in our meditation? By 
giving up effort. 
Therefore the secret lies not in mastering an array of techniques or in 
enrolling in expensive meditation courses. It requires assuming 
a state of surrender to an inward-focused, passive vulnerability. 



![](/images/tommedi2.jpg)

**
*Surrender to the Flow*


In this 
vulnerable state, untouched by identity-formation or 
story-weaving, we access a self-oscillating state of 
consciousness where our inner world is amplified in an 
[introspective feedback loop](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness). 
When we love ourselves enough to live in the sensitivity of our 
inner wounds we enter the echo chamber of the inner cathedral. 
For me, this sacred chamber is the true spaceholder of the 'flow' phenomenon. 
From this perspective, glow encapsulates self-love in its 
latent potential, while flow signifies self-love in its most 
dynamic manifestation.


Stress, 
Trauma and Flow: 
The Delicate Balance****
It's important to note, however, that even mild, chronic stress 
can render this creative tranquility elusive. Intriguingly, 
certain practices that temporarily disrupt the body's 
homeostasis, such as sauna therapy, winter bathing, or 
specialized breathing exercises, can not only initiate this flow 
but potentially enhance it as well. Furthermore, even 
experiences as severe as childhood trauma might, in some 
instances, trigger remarkable flow as a survival response. 
The legend of Holger the Dane 
serves as a compelling example of this nuanced relationship 
between stress and flow, emphasizing the need for a finely tuned 
balance to fully tap into the transformative potential of this 
remarkable state of consciousness.


Flow in the Garden of Eden

**The Genesis verse, *
[By 
the sweat of your face you shall eat bread](https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm)*, is often 
interpreted as signifying the hardship, toil, and effort needed 
to sustain oneself in life. It's part of the curse laid on Adam 
after the Fall, symbolizing the transition from an effortless 
existence in the Garden of Eden to a life of labor and struggle.**
In today's context, such existential burdens could serve as 
potent catalysts for chronic stress.



However, when viewed through the lens of meditative, effortless 
flow, this biblical axiom offers an intriguing counterpoint. 
Meditation and the philosophy of "effortless flow" strive to 
transition us from a realm of hardship to one of ease and 
equilibrium, akin to a return to the Edenic state of being.



Flow in the lab of science

**The human brain, as we understand it currently, can be 
thought of as containing two primary systems or modes of 
operation: the default mode network (DMN) and the task-positive 
network (TPN). These systems can be seen as metaphors for the 
contrasting states of being referenced in the Genesis verse and 
in the art of meditation.**


The [
Default Mode Network (DMN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network) could be thought of as the system 
related to the "sweat of your face" state. When this system is 
dominant, we're often engaged in self-referential thinking – 
planning, worrying, ruminating, dwelling on the past, fretting 
about the future. This network is associated with a state of 
mental tension or 'sweat,' as it often involves effortful 
control, self-discipline, and toil. In a way, this network 
symbolizes the post-Eden state of existence, where life is often 
seen as a struggle or a series of tasks to be completed. The 
DMN-network is not able to lead the way into meditation, but out 
of old habits we again and again let this system take the 
charge.



The
[
Task-Positive Network (TPN)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/task-positive-network), on the other hand, is active 
when we're fully engaged in a task in the present moment, where 
our attention is wholly absorbed in what we're doing. This could 
be likened to the state of effortless flow found in 
meditation. This network is also linked with nonjudgmental 
awareness and acceptance, key elements in meditation and 
mindfulness practices.



In the light of these two systems, the practice of meditation 
can be seen as a way to cultivate the capacity to shift more 
readily from the DMN to the TPN – from a state of 'sweat' and 
struggle to a state of effortless flow and presence.



THE SOUL SURFER AND THE ART OF 
FLOW**



![](/images/surfing.jpg)


Let me introduce the concept of the Soul Surfer, an 
individual existing in a heightened, yet effortless state of 
dynamic [super-awareness](/ouroboros/embodiment-of-ouroboros) as 
described in the chapter of the same name. The surfboard, 
lacking its own propulsion, gains momentum from a nuanced 
balance between the surfer and the elemental forces of nature.**


The intrinsic beauty of this imagery lies in the harmonious 
symbiosis between the wave and the surfer. This equilibrium 
encapsulates the very essence of flow. Much like a surfer, 
propelled by a colossal wave, experiences an awe-inspiring 
moment, we too can navigate the powerful tides of our internal 
and external worlds while maintaining a state of mindful 
equilibrium.



In this state, the Soul Surfer isn't simply a meditator immersed 
in a non-dual consciousness. He isn't enlightened in the 
conventional sense. Instead, he serves as an extraordinary 
exception—a ceaseless, dual balancing act in the dance of 
perpetual motion within the framework of space and time. He 
surfs on the razor's edge between duality and non-duality. Here, 
a palpable sense of danger and risk coexists with an utter trust 
in the unfolding process.



Super-aware, yet curiously resembling a sleepwalker devoid of 
conscious intent, the Soul Surfer has the unique capability to 
safely navigate the towering crests of emotional waves and the 
unpredictable terrains of external circumstances.



The Soul Surfer, in this respect, is a flawless speck of dust in 
the eye of the Divine. We humans are, in 
this sense, 
the universe's perfect Quasimodos—wondrous anomalies capable of 
surfing the dynamic energies of space-time duality. It is within 
those who can channel these energies beyond the constraints of 
the ego that spontaneous meditative action manifests.



As we shall delve into later, a more advanced operating system 
of super-awareness 
modulates this dynamic balance between the opposing yet 
complementary forces of Yin and Yang—functioning on dimensions 
far beyond the scope of human cognitive understanding. To master 
this modulation requires an entirely new form of identity, one 
that transcends our conventional, ego-based selves.



This delicate balance cannot be attained by our antiquated, 
lethargic ego-centric operating systems. Nor can it be achieved 
by subscribing to others' directives, or by clinging to the 
dogmas of traditional religions that emerged in eras without an 
appreciation for individuality. Only through an unwavering 
presence of consciousness, free from superfluous thought, can 
one successfully navigate this flow without succumbing to the 
turbulence of life's unpredictable waves.



In juxtaposition, Eastern spiritual philosophies often present 
the ideal of a wave without a surfer—a concept implying the 
diminished role or even absence of individuality. This 
perspective contrasts sharply with the idea of dynamic balance, 
highlighting different cultural attitudes towards the role of 
the individual in the broader cosmology of flow.

*Notice the boats that are at the mercy of the 
waves.

You can barely make out an insignificant

person in the boat on the left.*




Indivi-Duality****: 
A Synchronized Surf of Conflicting Life-forces****
From an evolutionary vantage point, flow emanates from a 
harmonic and dynamic synchrony among the eternal conflicting 
voices within our interior choir. In a broader sense, it 
epitomizes a deep equilibrium achieved among the myriad and 
diverse operating systems within the human organism, as 
discussed in the chapter,
* 
[
Consiousnes & Evolution](/consciousness/consciousness-and-evolution)**.* 




As soul surfers, we are intimately close to our own emotions, 
but within the balanced point of the conscious present, we're 
not tossed around by inner emotional storms. In the same flow we 
are attentive to our marvellous advisors called cognition, 
intellect, and thought but without allowing them to by tyrants.





In this impossible middle way, we're intelligently propelled 
forward in the flow by our body's innate life force in its 
unfathomable interplay with the multible forces outside of us.




Consciousness must here journey back to its unconscious origins, 
and the further we regress, the less language and conceptual 
understanding we can carry with us. In this realm, we become 
aware of things rather than comprehending them, experiencing 
them directly instead of grasping them through intellect.



The Devine Animal**


*Mankind is poised midway between **
the gods and the beasts
*
Plotinus





![](/images/buddhadyr.jpg)


Note the demon 
like primitive head

the boddhisatva is sitting on.

For me it seems this beast

could be much more happy

on a surf board.


One could certainly argue that 
acting instinctively with fewer thoughts marks a return to a 
more animalistic state. Indeed, it does. In this context, 
fostering super-awareness essentially transforms the primal 
instincts within us into something divine, while also allowing 
the divine aspect of ourselves to find solace in our human 
animality. Through this dual transformation, the human caught 
between the divine and the beastly can navigate life with the 
poised action of a legendary figure like Holger the Dane or, 
more contemporarily, as a member of the Beach Boys.


Within the framework of 
bio-operative systems, achieving a balanced state of flow 
involves becoming "multilingual" in a unique sense. This 
multilingualism doesn't merely refer to speaking different human 
languages, but to understanding and interpreting the diverse 
"languages" spoken by the various operative systems within us. 
These systems, each hailing from different evolutionary 
epochs—from the complexity of modern cognitive functions back to 
the primal instincts inherited from our pre-Cambrian 
ancestors—communicate through distinct channels and signals.



The modern, cognitive mind communicates using structured 
language and logical reasoning. It's the part of us that's 
hyper-attuned to verbal interactions, written instructions, and 
abstract thought. However, alongside this cognitive "language," 
there are older, more primal systems that speak in non-verbal 
cues like bodily sensations, gut feelings, and emotional shifts. 
These are the languages of our animalistic heritage, relics from 
evolutionary periods when survival depended on instinct and 
reflex rather than abstract reasoning. There are hundred 
different animals within us and they don't understand our little 
cognitive king and even further: they do not understand each 
other.



Practices like meditation and therapy help us become 
multilingual in the way of a-ha super-awareness. Super-awarenes 
is a multi-lingual translator that teach us how to interpret the 
various bio-signals conveyed by our different bio-operative 
systems. For example, while engrossed in a conversation with 
your boss, your cognitive mind may be laser-focused on the 
words, evaluating their implications for your career. 
Simultaneously, the older, more primal systems might signal 
discomfort through a tightening stomach or shallow breathing.



Because our modern lives are so oriented toward cognitive, 
language-based interaction, we often become monolingual, 
ignoring or misinterpreting the signals sent by our older 
operative systems. Such a limited understanding can lead to a 
state of imbalance and disrupt our flow navigation. It's like 
trying to navigate a multilingual city with proficiency in only 
one language; you'll miss out on the richness and depth of the 
full experience, and may even find yourself lost or in 
uncomfortable situations.



The less non-verbal "a-ha" 
[super-awareness](/ouroboros/embodiment-of-ouroboros) we possess of our internal 
bodily state, the shallower the communication between the divine 
and the animalistic parts within us becomes. True, profound 
flow-individuality can only manifest in an awareness field that 
is deeply rooted and intricately connected to bodily sensations, 
from the hair on our head right down to the subtlest feelings in 
our feet.



EGO-DEATH AND FLOW IN SUPER-AWARENESS**


*All change is a dying.**Wherefore we die from time to time.
*

*
[Meister Eckhart ](/western-mystics) *


The meditative feedback in accellerating 
[body-awareness](/consciousness/the-mystery-of-awareness) is not a 
static event. 

Here our inner body becomes a 
spatial canvas for an incredibly broad spectrum of bubbling 
colors, emotions, and energy flows. Most of them of are almost 
indescribable. The enhanced awareness creates a river of nuanced feelings, which in 
turn provoke spontaneous creative actions in the world often in 
elegance and graceful dance bypassing the more slow thought 
based cognitive systems who are the preferred tools of the old 
ego.



Place an old school ego on a surfboard, and watch it falter

**To become a soul surfer, one must give up the old school ego operating 
system's overly slow and rigid control. The one who constantly 
has to control through thought based actions is thrown off the 
surfboard. However, there is a higher form of 'control', a 
control which is an integral property of a potentiated state of 
conscious super-awareness without too 
many, but instead significant, thoughts.**
In this higher consciousness operating system, there is lesser 
room for any ego-based doing or exertion. Everything happens by 
itself in an organic life that is its own cause, that creates 
itself in higher and higher forms of order depending on the 
clarity and intensity of awareness.



The old ossificated ego-catapillar****
The conventional DMN system 
operates through an ego entity, gaining its capacity for action 
through strenuous effort and a repetitive self-narrative: "*I am 
the doer*." This traditional ego, a personality that clings to 
control, incessantly strives to maintain a status quo. It tends 
to be self-perpetuating, aiming to ensure its own survival and 
the preservation of its kind. As Meister Eckhart puts it, "*It is 
every man's intention that his work should be himself*."


The tendency is ever towards self-repetition, 


towards the preservation of 
the species:

it is every man' s intention that his work should be himself.

Meister Eckhart


Such a rigid old school ego represents an 
operating system that has arguably surpassed its 
psycho-evolutionary expiration date. However, I do not advocate 
waging war against this ego. Such action only reinforces its 
strength, as struggle, polarization, and effort are precisely 
the tools the ego uses to consolidate its power. Instead, the 
ego should gently be starved of its influence, suffused with 
kindness and love, or rather, better yet, be transformed like 
the catarpillar into a butterfly. After 
all, without an entity within us that prioritizes its own 
survival, we could not exist at all.


Transitioning from Ego to Essence-Entity in Flow

**An ego, illuminated by humor and heightened awareness, 
does not present an obstacle, nor should it be dissolved. 
Instead, it transforms into a fluid core essence. 
This internal flow persona possesses an innate capacity for 
action. Its power is instinctive and spontaneous, 
requiring no effort. The actions of this revitalized river-ego 
are as autonomous as our bodily functions like hair growth, 
heartbeat regulation, and digestion. Other activities like 
breathing and sexual activity straddle the boundary between 
conscious control and involuntary response. Our innate ability 
to meditate, replete with its astounding revelations, resides 
within this same intriguing domain. The emerging meditative individuality 
seamlessly blends into a constant state of flow, devoid of 
anything else than situation based self-importance. It learns incessantly through acknowledging its 
own errors and is akin to our soul surfer, reveling in the invigorating 
waves of life's ocean. 


**The New Ego Dies to Live

**Such an 
enlightened ego does not fear its own demise but recognizes its 
own continuous cycle of death and rebirth. In this context, 
meditation embodies[ *la petit mort*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_petite_mort) 
- a brief respite - fostering the emergence of a rejuvenated 
ego-entity. A participant in this cosmic play, or leela, 
undergoes a kind of rebirth with each meditation session, 
repeatedly experiencing death and life multiple times within one 
lifespan. It's a profound humility where every time you concede, 
"*Yes, you were right - I was wrong*," you die only to live 
again.


**The Triumvirate of Meditation, 
Psychedelics, and Therapy

**Drawing on insights from my 
personal introspective explorations, I posit that the meditative 
flow necessitates an elevated level of neurochemical 
interactions within the brain, guiding us towards a heightened 
foundational state of wakefulness. 
**


In this context, the careful use of psychedelics may act as 
a powerful tool for mastering the art of psychological death, 
thus enhancing a deeper appreciation for life. On a substantial 
dose of a psychedelic, you will likely experience psychological 
death in one form or another. With time, you become accustomed 
to this sensation of losing control, a familiarity that can 
indeed make you a more adept navigator in our tumultuous era of 
big data and disruption.



Among 
the transformative methodologies I've encountered on my path, 
the most impactful constitutes a triumvirate: meditation, 
therapy, and psychedelics. Within this triad, it is paramount 
for meditation to lead the charge, guiding the collective force 
towards the intended target.




This threefold cultivation provides a composite efficacy that 
surpasses the capacities of each individual element. Acting as a 
potent amalgamated remedy, it holds the potential to subdue the 
resilient habitual bodily systems that otherwise tend to return 
us to our despair after a fleeting breakthrough. Escaping the 
gravitational pull of our burdensome earthly habits such as low 
self-esteem, childhood traumas, and the like, requires potent 
propulsive forces. This triumvirate, however, is equipped to 
catalyze the metamorphosis of the ego from a stagnant pond into 
a flowing stream.


Effortless Intelligent Action: 
The Precedence of Action Over Thought

**Thought, ego, and control are intricately linked. For those 
liberated from the constraints of thought and ego, actions 
become instinctively spontaneous, so swift that one's actions 
may seem unbeknownst to oneself. Self-knowledge necessitates a 
certain degree of separation; to comprehend oneself requires 
space. Controlling oneself through thought processes demands 
both time and space, hence individuals with high self-control 
often appear somewhat slow in their actions.**



The authentic Individual

**Let us return to the
[previous mentioned](#The_illusive_nature_of_illusions_) 
discussion about the existence of a true individuality. Authentic communication is an energy liberator. It's simply 
inefficient to guide one's life based on the ego's dictates. The 
ego, in contrast to our core personality, incessantly expends 
energy to maintain its facades.**


Once again, it's crucial to remember that this 
core essence is not a fixed, tangible 'entity', but rather a 
harmonious dance of [heightened 
awarenes](/ouroboros/embodiment-of-ouroboros), orchestrating 
optimal dynamic compromises among our internal, conflicting 
biological operating systems that have evolved since our 
inception as life forms.



Contrary to the views of
[
Professor Hans Georg Müller](https://philpeople.org/profiles/hans-georg-moeller) and philosophers from various 
epochs, cultures, and schools of thought, I assert the existence 
of genuine individuality. A healthy human operative system 
embodies a distinct, subjectively felt subjectivity. Labeling 
this authenticity as an illusion is as futile as attempting to 
locate it in the pineal gland.



To cultivate authenticity from this viewpoint, take to heart 
Socrates' timeless counsel: "*Know thyself*." Yet, pursue 
this not as an intellectual exercise, but as an interoceptive 
journey in heightened somatic self-awareness.





WHAT PREVENTS FLOW**


Only a 
few are mature enough to stare into God's magical mirror



Embracing the Magic Mirror of God: Meister Eckhart posits that 
only a handful are mature enough to gaze into God's mystical 
mirror.
If we, like Adam and Eve, see ourselves, our own nakedness, in 
the first layer of budding meta-consciousness, taken 
quasi-hostage by an angry and condemning patriarch, it is not a 
good situation. Meta-consciousness and the
[super-awareness](/ouroboros/embodiment-of-ouroboros) that follows needs to be liberated from 
this Jahveh-like figure to fully unfurl its sails.



46 years ago, when I was a young man of 23, I experienced 
my first explosion of light. This epiphany ignited a year-long 
period of intense ecstasy and bliss. What followed was a time 
when I was able to internally observe what had previously been 
mercifully concealed. I was shocked to recognize my own 
negativity, low self worth and hidden aggressiveness. Like Adam and Eve, I found 
myself not naked, but nonetheless steeped in shame. Low 
self-esteem, guilt, and negative thinking had always been 
present, but now I confronted them directly in God's magical 
mirror of Consciousness. Gradually, I began to cleanse my inner 
domain of the filth that had lurked there in the darkness. This 
cleansing process unfolded not in duality, but in an odd sense 
of unity that embraced and transformed everything. This 
self-cleansing labor of love has been ongoing ever since. 
However, I can assert that it accelerated around the age of 60. 
But don't let that dissuade you from feeling inspired. Each 
small increment of integrated self-healing and interoceptive 
psycho-somatic self-knowledge enhances the present day, making it better than 
the last. **


I dropped out of university for almost two years: one year in 
bliss and one year in darkness and frustration. However, after 
rediscovering a new balanced state, I was surprised to find my 
ability to concentrate for extended periods had significantly 
improved. With this newfound focus, I joyfully returned and 
completed my academic journey in a state of flow.



A meta-consciousness contaminated by guilt is something I 
perceive primarily as a historical developmental phase, a 
conflict of timing between the emergence of a modern meta-brain 
and an outdated cultural operating system, busily engaged in 
dividing the world into good and evil.



Sartre posits that humans are doomed to self-awareness. I 
interpret his assertion as acknowledging the pain that the birth 
of self-awareness inflicts on innocence. However, these birth 
pangs should not deter us from entering this "fall from grace," 
which can usher us to unprecedented peaks and depths of 
innocence. Armed with a modern, updated cultural operating 
system, I would argue that meta-consciousness is the only force 
that can redeem us from our inherent folly.



The pinnacle of awareness buckles under the weight of guilt, 
shame, and low self-esteem accumulated in the form of family 
karma through generations. Truly awakened consciousness can 
only flourish to the extent that you liberate yourself from the 
constraints of your own thoughts— to the extent that 
self-hatred, shame, and despair have been transmuted by the 
transformative power of the magic mirror of consciousness.


As noted by
[Eckhart 
Tolle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle), there's typically a significant amount of 
interoceptive pain experienced within the body, what he refers 
to as the "*pain-body*". This discomfort straddles the boundary 
between psychological and physical pain, essentially 
representing the cumulative impact of various forms of stress 
that the conscious mind has failed to address. Intriguingly, 
this pain gradually diminishes and eventually dissipates through 
a healing process when it's embraced within the context of 
abstract [super-awareness](/ouroboros/embodiment-of-ouroboros). Actualy all this inner pain is the 
united cry of all our inner animals in their frustration of not 
being invited to the party of conscious life.



I can't overlook the final prerequisite for the flourishing of 
super-aware flow: freedom from judgment. As Rumi so eloquently 
put it, *Beyond the realm of right and wrong, there is a 
field. I'll meet you there*. This highlights the necessity of 
moving beyond judgment to fully immerse ourselves in a state of 
super-awareness.



Every act of judgment against another person or situation is, in 
essence, a form of self-judgment rooted in self-dislike. In this 
context, it's important to clarify that it is indeed possible to 
identify wrongdoings in others or in situations around you. 
However, it's crucial to recognize that if doing so evokes 
negative emotions within you, what you're actually witnessing is 
a reflection of your own deficiencies in love.




The Cosmic Fool

**The archetype of The Fool is shielded by youth, optimism, 
and a freedom from judgment. When you reach an age approaching 
70, as I have, and still feel youthful, you become an even 
greater fool than The Fool itself.

PART II - THE SUPERNATURAL FLOW

****
Harnessing Intelligent Conscious Systems That 
Transcend Entropy



**Certainly, for many of you readers who have embarked on deep 
meditative journeys, there may be experiences that defy rational explanation. 
Instances of synchronicity, miraculous occurrences, and paranormal phenomena 
that cannot easily be dismissed nor confined to empirical investigation. **


In this chapter we will discus what could potentially happen if Holger the Dane 
had kept sitting in his trance like state, like the Indian yogis from ancient 
times.



Thus, I propose we take a moment to explore the boundaries of what may be 
considered unorthodox or even pseudoscientific. By doing so, we open ourselves 
to possibilities that traditional science may overlook or dismiss.



Synchronicity**, for example, often appears as meaningful coincidences that 
connect our inner thoughts with external events in ways that are both mysterious 
and profound. How does one quantify the connection between a deeply personal 
contemplation and the unexpected appearance of a symbol or event that perfectly 
mirrors that thought?**


Miracles**, likewise, challenge our understanding of natural laws. Healing, 
transformation, or intervention in a time of dire need, seemingly facilitated by 
a higher power or universal consciousness, defy explanation.**


Paranormal events**, such as telepathy, precognition, or even the subtle awareness 
of another's feelings or thoughts, push us further into the realm of the 
unexplained.**


These phenomena invite us to question and expand our understanding of reality. 
While they may not fit neatly into a scientific test-tube, they are nonetheless 
part of the rich tapestry of human experience.



In embracing these enigmatic occurrences, we need not abandon reason or 
scientific inquiry. Instead, we can acknowledge that our current understanding 
of the universe, as vast as it may be, still has its limitations. Our tools and 
methodologies evolve, and what once seemed implausible or even impossible may 
one day find its place within the broader context of knowledge and exploration.



Abundance

**I would also like to add the concept of abundance to this magical equation. 
Spontaneous abundance-flow occurs only in a relaxed, greed-free space of 
heightened awareness. Subjectively, it feels as though the entire universe is 
presenting you with everything on a platter. Time and space collapse, and waves 
of bliss appear before you in the form of life's fruits, which you distribute 
around you, partaking only of what you need yourself. You return to existence 
through a currency known as gratitude and personal happiness.**


Does this sound too good to be true? Indeed, it does! It's a miracle, but not 
the greatest of all miracles. The fact that we, a collection of buzzing, 
whirling molecules, are alive in human form constitutes the greatest of all 
miracles. When you truly contemplate it, it's astonishing, bordering on the 
unbelievable.



The magic flow of conscious life

**I have decided to include these thoughts in this chapter, which is focused on 
describing flow. To me, the above phenomena, such as synchronicity, miracles, 
and paranormal events, all share a flow-like quality. They manifest in the 
sphere of human interaction with the external world, a realm that remains beyond 
the controlling grasp of the ego.**


By indulging in a bit of pseudoscience, we allow ourselves to dream, to wonder, 
and to embrace the full spectrum of human experience. We acknowledge that not 
everything can be measured, categorized, or explained, and in doing so, we open 
ourselves to the awe and mystery that makes life a truly magical journey.


As the yin 
requires a touch of yang and vice versa, science should not altogether shun the 
immeasurable, for the frontiers of scientific legitimacy are not rigid, but 
evolve as our understanding and methodologies progress.



Countless theories once deemed outside the scientific purview have been 
integrated into our knowledge as our tools and perspectives evolved. For 
instance, quantum physics, now underpinned by extensive empirical evidence, was 
initially considered conjectural.


The 
[yin and yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang) 
that mold us into glowing and flowing surfers of the soul are
super-[awareness](/consciousness/the-mystery-of-awareness) in ouroboric
[consciousness](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia). Consciousness 
sprang from the slumbering bodily awareness within the single cells of the 
Precambrian ocean. These cells were the pioneers in focusing the light of the 
all-encompassing pan-consciousness. Suddenly, human consciousness began to 
spread its wings, soaring into the grand heights of abstraction. It almost 
forgot the body from which it originated, creating entire universes from 
imagination and words. In this profound state, consciousness started to loop 
back onto itself in some individuals, evolving both qualitatively and 
quantitatively into super-aware [ouroboros-consciousness.](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness)



In this explosive state, it is now on the verge on entering the next level from 
catapilar to butterfly: It begins to illuminate the body with its radiant 
darkness. 


Drawing from my personal journey, I can attest 
that the dimensions of time and space yield to the commanding force of a strong 
combined ouroboros field of consciousness that has descended into 
super-awareness. Once this descend reaches a certain 
intensity, phenomena start to occur that seemingly challenge the bounds of 
scientific understanding. 
My life is full of these miracles, but out of privacy reasons I will only 
narrate a few of them here.



Does consciousness collapse the waveform?**








In essence, Dean Radin's experiment proposes that particles respond 
differently based on the 'quality' of the observing consciousness. 
Sabine Hossenfelder, in her illuminating 'old school' YouTube 
presentation discussing the relationship between

[
Consciousness and Quantum Mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1wqUCATYUA&list=FL3KHXSUtwjsLrj3XSudytkQ&index=1), points out that this 
experiment has not yet been replicated. I would argue that this 
experiment should not be dismissed until it has been conducted with a 
group of experienced Tibetan monks, whose frontal lobes are pulsating 
with gamma waves. It is my contention that only a embodied ouroboros 
consciousness has the potential to influence time and space, as opposed 
to an ordinary human brain-derived consciousness.





**
Tony Woody's near-death experience

**In the YouTube video below, Tony Woody describes his near-death 
experience. One would be hard-pressed to find a more beautiful 
and precise description of super-awarenes in ouroboric consciousness. Tony experiences, 
in what he believes are the last seconds of his life, a true 
fireworks display of an expanded consciousness. 
The experience of 
chaos and catastrophe is transformed into sublime perfection in 
his superconsciousness, even though the experience confused his 
thinking mind.






**Embodied **


**Ouroboros Consciousness "nudges" Reality****


What Shielded Tony Woody from Catastrophe?



The most probable outcome of Tony Woody's predicament would have led to 
a disastrous plane crash, resulting in fatal injuries and destruction. 
However, I posit that Tony Woody's miraculous survival was ignited by an 
ouroboros-consciousness that instantaneously enveloped him at the brink 
of his perceived demise. The sort of miraculous flow ensuing from a 
fully-fledged singular ouroboros consciousness carries a distinctive 
quality when juxtaposed with the creative flow we delved into at the 
commencement of this chapter.



This unique 'Tony Woody-flow' appears to manipulate the fabric of time 
and space.



The numerous near-death experiences, also documented and shared on platforms like YouTube in our current era 
suggest that this superconsciousness acts not only as an observer but 
also as an orchestrator, possessing a paradoxical ability to be aloof in 
a state of untouchable transcense while at the same time being able to 
manipulate events in time and space.



Such a strange dual function is difficult for scientists to accept 
seriously, typically dismissing it as pseudoscience. However, as 
Einstein emphasized, science cannot thrive without imagination. Let me 
illustrate this dual aspect of consciousness, which simultaneously 
exists beyond time and space while also having the capacity to influence 
them.



What do you do in front of a mirror?

**Consider standing in front of a mirror: our behavior changes. We comb 
our hair, inspect for wrinkles, or apply makeup. The mirror remains 
indifferent to our actions. Similarly, organic life develops complex 
brains within the omnipresent mirror of pan-consciousness. These complex 
systems create time-space-bound copies of the transcendent 
pan-consciousness. This pan-consciousness, in its inherent form, as a 
Kantian *
[thing-in-itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself)*, remains indifferent to my biological manifestation 
of smal mirrors of consciousness, the *thing-for-us*, or more precisely, the 
thing-for-me.**


This notion suggests that while omnipresent pan-consciousness is indifferent and 
exists beyond our individual experience, our personal consciousness, 
formed by our complex brains, is its imitated representation in time and space 
and is capable of influencing our actions and experiences.



The Trial in the Book of Job

**As [C.G. Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) 
outlines in his work, "*[Answer 
to Job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_Job),*" it is the humble figure of Job, post God's trial, who 
surprisingly emerges as the more sympathetic character. Job, a fragile 
mortal, effectively 'triumphs' over God by withstanding all of His 
severe and inhumane trials.**


The focused luminescence of humanity, in spite of its fragility, 
encapsulates an element absent in God's infinite and omnipresent light. 
Jung infers that God, after the trial of Job, thus 'decides' to take on 
human form.



The advent of the Son of Man is subsequently prophesied within the 
tribulations of Job. And who is the Son of Man? It embodies, as Meister 
Eckhart proposes, every virtuous and devout individual.



The replica surpasses the original.

**I dare to extend Jung's postulation by asserting that this scenario 
demonstrates how the replica can surpass the original. Job manifests 
more divine characteristics than God, in the sense that he concentrates 
the light of consciousness. What incarnates within humanity is the 
immensely more potent embodied ouroboros-consciousness, which is why miracles 
seem to orbit a brain resonating in gamma-mode. This 
[atma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman)-consciousness, 
despite its immense force, is dualistic and a product of the brain. It 
emerges within the time-space continuum, and thus, is somewhat bound by 
natural laws. However, as a time-space 'reflection' of 
[brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman)-consciousness, it is capable of manifesting miracles. We, as 
humans, all possess the feedback capability of super-aware ouroboros-consciousness. 
Nonetheless, only a handful of brains will undergo a full-blown singular 
explosion of superconsciousness required to facilitate miracles of the 
magnitude attributed to Jesus.**


Thus, God crafted humanity in His own likeness, aiming to live in a 
magnified and glorified form through this reflection. It seems he love 
to eat sushi.

**

**

The Ubiquitous 
Proximity of Super-consciousness

**One of the most important characteristics of ouroboros super-consciousness is 
that it does not seem to be caught up in the alienating distance that a 
normal conscious dual subject-object relation always entails. **
Pay close attention to Tony Woody's description of the Pepsi can (4:50) that 
passes by the cockpit in a split second. In Tony's superconscious state, 
he 'sees' all of the Pepsi droplets at once in slow motion. He talks 
about how his soul left his body and had a view of everything from any 
point in space. "*I became the debris,*" he says:





*I had a 360-degree 
bubble vision view of every one of these millions of perspectives, even 
from the tiniest debris in the air.*




The conundrum we face is: How can 
consciousness, derived from the brain, emulate the non-dual state of 
primordial consciousness?



Brain-derived consciousness appears to surmount duality by generating an 
infinite number of bubble-like subject-object relationships, 
encompassing perspectives from the infinitely grand to the infinitely 
minute.



The Krishna Leela of Consciousness

**This phenomenon mirrors what we find in the profound wisdom of 
ancient India. Here Krishna, who personifies pure consciousness, 
multiplies himself, creating sufficient copies to engage in a divine 
dance with each of the gopi maidens, akin to the dance of Pepsi 
droplets. This is true divine flow. The Indians call it *
[Krishna leela,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna)* 
playful fun.





![](/images/krishnadance.jpg)




In this operational 
mode, embodied ouroboros consciousness oscillates between duality and non-duality. It 
appears ubiquitous in range yet remains wholly tangible, 
reminiscent—only metaphorically—of the superposition principle 
in quantum mechanics.**


It's crucial to underline once more that consciousness—whether it be the 
non-dual transcendent or the dual brain-derived— not inherently 
'perform' any of these actions. What we witness and interpret are the 
various manifestations of consciousness within time and space, akin to 
surmising a woman's recent encounter with a mirror upon observing her 
neatly combed hair and fresh makeup. I would also like to remind you of 
the footprints of the invisible thief in the chapter, 




[
What is Consciousness](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia#The_Enigmatic_Buddhas_Footprints_)[.](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia#The_Enigmatic_Buddhas_Footprints_)



As discussed in that chapter, 
consciousness is fundamentally transcendental, markedly distinct from 
the objects mirrored within it. Yet embodied ouroboros-consciousness operates like a 
magical mirror, enabling phenomena deemed improbable in the reflection 
of ordinary consciousness.



The miracles made by super-aware ouroboros-consciousness represents the 
observable trace within time and space of the *ding an sich* superconsciousness . In this 
context, it offers the only fingerprint we possess of our unseen 
visitor.



Embodied Ouroboros-Consciousness and Evolution: A New Perspective

**Descended Ouroboros-consciousness is perhaps the pinnacle of evolutionary 
innovation, symbolizing a survival mechanism unparalleled in complexity. 
When referencing evolution here, it's vital to clarify that I don't 
confine myself to a strictly Darwinian framework. Instead, I envision 
evolution as a dynamic push-pull system, with Darwin's principles 
metaphorically 'pushing' evolution forward, while the future 
simultaneously exerts a 'pull.'**


Anton Petrov, in a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/k_B9YP5nEWw) 
titled "*Obscure Biochemical Paradox May Explain Why We Can't Find Alien 
Life*," illustrates a paradox that suggests protein chains necessary for 
life shouldn't be able to fold in supportive ways. The title could very 
well read: "*Obscure Biochemical Paradox May Explain Why There Cannot Be 
Life on Earth*." If Darwinian principles solely guided the evolution of 
protein chains, life as we know it would be improbable. The odds of even 
one life-affirming protein chain folding correctly are so astronomical 
(a number with 300 digits to one) that it borders on the impossible.



Therefore, regardless of the validity of my intuitive retro-causal 
theory, life seems to transcend the confines of scientific test tubes, 
suggesting a dimension beyond mere chance and survival mechanisms.



So, I boldly assert that embodied ouroboros-consciousness, with its explosive 
manifestation and biological complexity far surpassing Darwinian 
evolution or mere probability, is fundamentally a miraculous creation. 
Its existence and function seem to transcend the ordinary, operating at 
what appears to be a paranormal level. Miraculous solutions, it seems, 
can materialize out of nowhere following a sudden and profound awakening 
of consciousness.



Throughout history, and across various cultures, tales of supernatural 
miracles persist, often attributed to divine intervention or the actions 
of extraordinary individuals. Some skeptics dismiss these phenomena as 
mere literary inventions, akin to the *
[Deus ex machina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina)* 
device in Greek theater, confining them to the realm of fantasy and 
whimsy.



But my perspective invites us to dream differently and to consider the 
possibility that something extraordinary lies at the heart of existence, 
something that defies conventional explanation and beckons us to explore 
further.



HOMEOSTASIS AND EMBODIED OUROBORIC CONSCIOUSNESS

**Earlier in this chapter, we briefly alluded to a potential 
relationship between sudden homeostatic stress and consciousness' 
self-perpetuating ouroboros-like implosion. A near-death experience 
precisely embodies such an event. Jesus hanging on the cross can easily 
be seen in the same perspective, a moment of ultimate life threathning 
crisis, that somehow provokes the 
embodied ouroboros consciousness to intervene as Deus ex Machina.







In India, there are countless stories about how the so-called 
enlightened ones, gurus, supernaturally intervened and saved their 
disciples from critical situations.**


When I resided near the majestic Himalayas in North India, I found 
friendship with an aged man named 
[Shabdanand](/inspirators/shabdanand). Shabdanand had been practizing 
meditation since childhood. A memory from his youth, vivid and stirring, was 
shared with me, one that has since remained etched in my mind.

In his younger days, Shabdanand had attempted to traverse a river during 
the treacherous monsoon season. The waters, influenced by heavy rains in the 
distant Himalayan foothills, surged violently and without warning. Swept 
away by the sudden deluge, Shabdanand was carried downstream at a terrifying 
pace, thrashing helplessly in the churning waters. As fear overwhelmed him, 
he cried out for his guru, Faqir Baba.



In that desperate moment, something extraordinary occurred. Faqir Baba's 
visage materialized before him, extending a hand that pulled him to the 
safety of the riverbank.



At the time, Shabdanand led a secular life as a so called household 
meditator, occupied with his family and home far from the spiritual haven of 
his master's ashram. The miraculous rescue ignited a spiritual longing to 
see his master in physical form. Driven by gratitude, he rushed to the 
ashram to prostrate himself at Faqir Baba's feet, his eyes brimming with 
tears of thankfulness.



Faqir Baba's response, however, was unexpected and perplexing. He denied any 
knowledge or involvement in the incident, declaring, "*I know nothing 
about this incident! I was not there. I did not help you*."



He continued with profound insight, "*It is your own faith, coupled with 
the power of your consciousness, that has saved you. You saved yourself.*"



Addressing the intrigued crowd, Faqir revealed a hidden truth, "*It is our 
own faith and inner strength that rescues us. Often, we fail to recognize 
this and instead attribute miracles to our Guru. As we ascend to higher 
realms in meditation, spontaneous miracles begin to occur. But beware of 
false gurus who exploit this ignorance, claiming they intervened and then 
thriving on the donations of grateful but misled followers.*"



This incident carries profound lessons and resonates with a deeper truth 
about the miraculous nature of consciousness. What I perceive in this 
narrative is a testament to our inherent ability to tap into the magical 
flow of existence, an ability that often lies dormant, neglected or 
misattributed.



The story emphasizes that belief in magic is not enough; it must be 
accompanied by the awakening wave of descended ouroboros consciousness. In this state, 
the miraculous emerges in times of sudden crisis, as if a Deus ex Machina, 
unfolding a wondrous tapestry that defies mere coincidence.

The quantum shotgun

**The development of the self feeding ouroboros-consciousness is a 
deterministic consequence of the holy mathematics' own unfolding. Like the 
Ouroboros serpent, this mathematics will bite its own tail, change its own 
course, and thereby abolish its own laws. I first encountered this line of 
thought outside of my own head when I attended a lecture by Holger Bech 
Nielsen as a high school teacher. He spoke of a particle that was shot out 
and hit itself, changing direction in the collision and therefore not 
hitting itself.

**OUROBOROS****-CONSCIOUSNESS 
AND ENTROPY****
Let's now focus on the manifestations of consciousness in space-time—ranging 
from the simple origins of single-cellular life to the intricate complexity 
of Homo sapiens. These self-referential feedback control systems operate 
with a teleological aim: to continually accelerate the development of 
evolutionary intelligence, thereby creating countercurrents against the 
universe's thermodynamic drift. Rather than succumbing to the chaotic pull 
of entropy, they endeavor to channel energy upstream, constructing
[pathways that lead 
to order and complexity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_and_life)


In this paradigm, consciousness isn't 
merely a passive byproduct of existence but an active, organizing force 
countering the universe's natural tilt toward disorder. Super-aware 
ouroboros-consciousness, in this light, embodies a higher-level 
understanding capable of reshaping reality itself, transcending conventional 
scientific paradigms. In this context, a unique sense of self-generated 
order emanates from those who perceive reality through the lens of this 
potentiated, omnipresent divine consciousness.




While the universe collectively adheres 
to the third law of thermodynamics, gravitating toward entropy and eventual 
heat death, the delicate sperm cell of conscious life swims defiantly 
against the current toward the waterfall of complexity. On this journey from 
disorder to order, life accrues greater intelligence, albeit at the cost of 
robustness.



Full-blown, super-aware ouroboros-consciousness is my wager for the future's 
control system of life. It is also the most vulnerable, as the most recently 
evolved elements are often the most fragile. We stand at an intersection 
between the obsolete ego-based operating system and an emerging 
super-conscious, super-intelligent control system. Linear, projective 
thinking is insufficient to foresee what lies ahead.



We humans, in our boundless self-aggrandizement, often consider intelligence 
to be a byproduct of our verbal articulations and endeavors. Yet, I propose 
that a form of intelligence far exceeding our comprehension is already 
immanent in the clarity of super-awareness.



Our brain's realm of thought and imagination is but a fractal simulation of 
a larger, inscrutable Intelligence. Projecting human characteristics onto 
this greater algorithmic Intelligence isn't entirely misplaced, as we 
ourselves are manifestations of this Intelligence.



In essence, if there is a God, it can only be us.

Today, our outdated egos drift 
aimlessly, confused and anxious, in the turbulent seas of big data. Our old 
cognitive control systems are ill-equipped to process the vast inputs we are 
currently exposed to. In the face of mounting chaos, as the world heats up, 
it's not fear but vigilant optimism that will be our salvation.



Perhaps, a miracle awaits.



The phoenix may rise anew 
from the ashes of a burning world, but only in the hearts unafraid of death 
in the fire. Embodied ouroboros-consciousness is the overlooked wildcard in 
the game of existence. It doesn't merely replicate the old phoenix but 
crafts a version far more authentic and beautiful. In its stand against the 
entropy's cold embrace, super-awareness unveils infinite realms of 
possibilities, each leading to new doors and fresh equilibriums governed by 
new rules.



Only The Fool can perceive and traverse these alternate realities.
