Hierarchy of Awareness




**




















THE 
HIERARCHY OF CONSCIOUSNESS & AWARENESS

* 
Beneath the Lion's Language*





A slumbering 'Wittgensteinian' Stone

**Wittgenstein 
famously claimed that if a lion could speak, *nobody* would 
understand it. In the spirit of this Wittgensteinian thought, I 
would go one step further: when we speak, *no-body* truly 
understands us either—not even *our own body* - because the speaking head is firmly rooted 
*in a body* that never learned to speak or understand 
language.**



Wittgenstein was right, but only within the confines of the 
narrow, thinking mind. In this sense his insight also reveals the ultimate hubris 
of the ego—a small, chattering entity that has conquered the 
realm of human forms through language and cognition, often at 
the expense of deeper and older intelligences.




Mystics across cultures have long mastered wordless languages. 
The tension between scribes and seers, between intellectuals and 
embodied mystics, is not new—it dates back to the time of the 
Buddha, of Jesus, and long before.



This chapter, then, is about misunderstanding.



More precisely: about who does not understand whom.



Awareness does not Know Us

**Now, let us view ourselves in an evolutionary timeline. What about 
the layers of awareness that existed before human consciousness 
emerged as described in the chapter 


[
Consciousness & Evolution](/consciousness/consciousness-and-evolution)? Does the heartbeat know it sustains a human? Does 
digestion recognize the human it nourishes? Are the countless cells and 
bacteria within us aware that they collectively form a living 
entity—a human being named Tom or Harry?**


The primordial awareness systems within us operate without 
recognition of our evolution into highly self-reflective, 
conscious beings. Just as fish cannot fathom the vast ocean they 
inhabit and ants cannot comprehend a modern highway they are 
about to cross, these 
ancient biological mechanisms function independently of the 
intricate cognitive structures that have emerged above them.



Who or What is in Charge? – The Hierarchy of Consciousness

**We like to think of thinking consciousness as the ruler of our 
being—rational, self-aware, and in control. But what if it’s not 
the master, but the servant?**


Consider this: the mitochondria in your cells, the bacteria in 
your gut, the viruses silently shaping your immune system. These 
ancient biological entities have been running the show for 
billions of years—not with malice, but through ancient patterns 
of coexistence. Cognitive consciousness, by contrast, is the 
'new kid 
on the block'—restless, adaptive, and primarily concerned with 
external survival. While we ponder philosophy, these microscopic 
sovereigns dictate the rhythms of digestion, immunity, and 
energy production without so much as a passing thought from us.





In this light, the mind’s loftiest ideals—reason, intellect, 
maybe even spirituality—are tireless serfs, laboring in service of 
these primordial rulers. We are, in a very real sense, vehicles 
for their agenda, blindly ensuring their continued survival 
while deluded in believing we are in charge.




It’s a provocative perspective, but one worth considering: Who 
is truly ruling whom? And what is concept of free will in this 
concept?




We do not know Our(many)selves

**It gives here sense to view all these layers of untimely 
biological operative systems as different *'personalities'* within 
ourselves. **


G.I.
[Gurdjieff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gurdjieff), 
the Greek-Armenian mystic, argued that ordinary humans live in a 
state of hypnotic 'waking sleep'. We are in his perspective not single, 
unified beings but rather a collection of a hundred different 
personalities—each unaware of the others. These fragmented 
selves take turns running the show, often contradicting or even 
figting one 
another without our recognition.




![](/images/human_dna_faces_gurdjieff.jpg)



Imagine a traveler with a clear destination. Along the way, his 
‘selves’ hijack the journey—one craving comfort stops for a 
drink, another seeking adventure veers off track, a third, 
fearful, turns him back. In the end, he never reaches his 
goal—not due to external obstacles, but because no single *‘I’* 
was truly in control.



Gurdjieff’s teaching emphasizes consciously witnessing this fragmentation as 
the first step toward self-unification. True inner mastery means 
transforming these competing impulses into a singular, 
harmonious *'I.'*



But why are we not naturally conscious of this inner chorus of 
personalities? Why 
do these hidden selves continue to shape our actions, thoughts, 
and emotions without our recognition—tricking us again and 
again?



The answer lies behind the closed doors of perception. And 
paradoxically, to open that door, we must first close our eyes.



Consciousness can Self-Transform

**Every time we close our eyes while remaining fully awake, we 
engage in an act of cultivation. As [Robert Ornstein](https://robertornstein.com/)’s
*'The Psychology of Consciousness'* demonstrates, 
consciousness is not only static but also trainable. **



In one experiment, an ordinary person quickly lost conscious 
awareness of a ticking clock as the brain filtered out the 
repetitive sound. A Zen monk, however, could sustain conscious awareness 
of the ticking indefinitely, demonstrating that consciousness, 
though naturally restless, can be cultivated into deep, 
sustained presence.




Unlike the older, more rigid, automated awareness systems that sustain life, 
consciousness possesses a fluid, self-transforming capacity—it 
can reshape itself through itself.



Know Thyself

**This ability to reprogram consciousness echoes the ancient 
inscription at the 
[Temple of Apollo: *Know thyself.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself) 
Through conscious self-awareness, we cultivate what I call 
liquid inner adaptation—a flexible responsiveness that allows us 
to integrate the deeper, more instinctual layers of our being. 
The beauty of consciousness lies in its potential to bridge this 
inner divide. With training, it can illuminate and embrace these 
unconscious patterns, gradually transforming them into embodied 
wisdom.**


As demonstrated by the Zen monk, the most recently evolved 
layers of consciousness—though young and fragile—hold the 
remarkable capacity to observe, understand, and begin 
integrating the older, more primal systems within us. This 
integration is what turns reactivity into insight, and instinct 
into presence.



Yet without introspection, we remain blind to what defines us 
most:

the silent, repetitive rhythms that animate life from within.



And in this subtle, fleeting trainability, consciousness may 
hint at a purpose beyond mere survival. This is the quiet, 
radical promise at the heart of spiritual evolution:
That consciousness might become an inner parliament—a forum 
where competing voices within us engage in dialogue, 
negotiation, and mutual understanding.



But how does something as deceptively simple as maintaining 
conscious awareness of a ticking clock lead to deeper 
self-knowledge? And even more importantly: what kind of language 
is spoken in this parliament? What is the *lingua franca* 
that could help us understand our own inner lion’s roar—or the 
quiet protest of mitochondria that feel underpaid for their 
tireless labor?



To approach these questions, we must dive deeper—beyond the 
mammalian-based personalities described by Gurdjieff and into 
the very watery fabric of awareness itself.
Here, in the layered currents beneath a calm sea, evolutionary 
strata of the brain conceal ancient tides.




BEYOND GURDIJEFF - MIRABAI'S WATERY WISDOM

**The Indian Saint Mirabai says:



'Oh Friend! 
Understand**
The body is like the ocean

Rich with hidden treasures.'



As explored in the chapter


[Consciousness and 
Evolution](/consciousness/consciousness-and-evolution), our 
bodies bear deep imprints of our aquatic origins—stretching back 
through more than 90% of evolutionary history, when life moved 
and morphed in the ocean’s embrace.



While Gurdjieff’s notion of fragmented inner 
personalities—impulse-driven children, ancestral voices, 
reactive monkeys—offers a sharp insight into the dissonance of 
our mammalian inheritance, it remains anchored in the relatively 
recent terrain of land-bound consciousness. These voices, loud 
as they may be, are newcomers on the evolutionary stage.



Mirabai’s vision reaches deeper. Her oceanic metaphor calls us 
to dive below the noisy surface of the mind, beyond the 
mammalian theater of fragmented drives, into
[the 
ancient, fluid intelligence that still pulses within us](/consciousness/consciousness-and-evolution#FROM_SEA_TO_LAND). The 
body as ocean—a living reservoir of hidden rhythms, pre-verbal 
memory, and liquid knowing—resonates viscerally for those who 
dare to turn inward and listen.



In my own experience, introspection carries a distinctly watery, 
oceanic quality. This perception aligns with the Tibetan 
understanding of humans as flowing water-bodies—fluid beings 
whose inner rhythms echo the primordial tides we once swam 
through. The currents within us carry evolutionary wisdom, 
emotional memory, and a subtle 
[language of sensation and energy](/fields/meditative-pixelation).



Both the Tibetan masters and Mirabai call us to explore this 
language—to consciously attune to the ancient, fluid codes 
embedded in the body’s biomass—or more precisely, its bio-water. 
Mirabai’s ocean is not merely a poetic flourish; it is a living 
truth. Her call is an invitation to reconnect with the deep, 
liquid intelligence of our being—where the treasures of life’s 
ancient memory continue to shimmer and flow.



From there, the journey inward unfolds not like walking, 
but—more accurately—like swimming blindfolded through inner 
rivers, guided not by intellect, but by what I call *'conscious 
innerstanding'*. This term, coined by the Danish mystic


[Emanuel S&oslash;rensen](/inspirators/sunyata), 
refers to an intuitive, embodied knowing that transcends 
conceptual thought. It is a wisdom born of direct, 

[
consciously aware](/consciousness/defining-awareness-consciousness#CONSCIOUS_AWARENESS_) a-ha 
moments, where the mind becomes an intimate witness to the 
ever-shifting tides of life within.
What do I mean by 'a-ha'? I mean taking notice in childlike 
innocence.



Let us now dive deeper into the unconscious nature of this inner 
ocean. As previously noted, the key to understanding it lies in 
the evolutionary development of the neocortex—a relatively new, 
still largely untrained region of awareness, finely tuned to 
external changing stimuli.



Its primary evolutionary role has been to ensure survival 
through cognition, continuously scanning for threats and 
opportunities that demand longer-term responses.



But there was little evolutionary advantage in tuning into the 
slow, subtle tides of what appeared to be a stable inner world. 
Nor were the quick, instinctive reactions of the older mammalian 
brain always enough. In this evolutionary balancing act, the 
neocortex emerged as a kind of middle path—capable of pausing, 
pondering, and projecting into the future.



It was no longer just about reacting. It became about thinking 
ahead—asking questions like: *'What should I do if the 
saber-toothed tiger comes back to the cave next week?'

*

From Ocean to Cortex

**Evolution layered a new structure atop that ancient tide: 
the neocortex. Tuned to volatile environments, it scans for 
threats and long-range opportunities alike. Yet what evolves 
last remains fragile; it has had the least time to stabilise. 
Hence the neocortex, for all its brilliance, faces two core 
challenges: it is buffeted on one side by mammalian surges of 
fear and rage, and on the other by the barely perceptible swell 
of slow but intense interoceptive tides…**


The first is well known: the emotional surges of the mammalian 
brain—fear, rage, panic. We’ve all experienced moments where 
we’ve lost our reason to this inner animal, hijacked by 
instinct.



But the second challenge is more insidious:

It comes *not* from explosive emotion, but from the slow, 
internal tides that move beneath our field of consciousness.



Consider the familiar metaphor of
[the frog in 
slowly heating water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog). The danger rises steadily, but the 
frog fails to react—because the change is too gradual, too 
subtle to register as a threat. In much the same way, our 
consciousness often overlooks the soft, continuous rhythms of 
our inner life. These currents carry no alarm bells for the 
cortex. They don’t trigger urgency. And so, we ignore them.



This, incidentally, is precisely how stress accumulates—quietly, 
invisibly—until it becomes embedded in our physiology without 
ever having announced its arrival.



Yet it is within these silent undercurrents that some of the 
deepest truths of our being reside.



To perceive them requires a different kind of attention. A 
refined and magnified 
[conscious awareness](/consciousness/defining-awareness-consciousness#CONSCIOUS_AWARENESS_) - a larger mirror or 
systems of mirrors.

A Zen-trained mind that can rest on something as seemingly 
trivial as the ticking of a clock—or the hum of a 
refrigerator—for minutes, hours, even days.




This deeper level of 
cultivated conscious perception allows us to 
become consciously aware of the ever-present, roaring, yet silent flow within our inner 
body-ocean.





Through the cultivation of introspection, we allow conscious 
awareness to engage with these layered dormant and slow moving 
awareness systems, fostering an integrated innerstanding where 
broader awareness can become conscious of itself in an 
ever-deepening dialogue between our watery existence and the 
mirror of conscious awareness.



The Medium Is the Message: To *Consciously Aware* Something Is 
Communication

**So what is the lingua franca in this inner parliament of 
selves and systems?**


It must be a language simple enough to be innerstood even by the 
most ancient, watery life-forms within us. It cannot be verbal. 
It cannot be intellectual. It must bypass cognition altogether.



My claim—based not on science but on nearly fifty years of daily 
meditation—is that this 'language' is embedded in conscious 
awareness itself. In this sense, conscious awareness is a 
harmonizing force between fragmented inner systems. The very a-ha moment of becoming 
consciously aware of a 
stomach full of butterflies is already a bridge across the 
communication gap. It is not analysis that connects us to our 
inner life, but innocent, sustained conscious attention.



To be silently, consciously aware of another human being is 
already a form of communication.
The same is true within ourselves: when we raise the level of 
conscious attention, we begin to 'speak' with the full range of 
inner personalities, land mammals, and sea creatures that make 
up our biology.



Raise awareness—and a symphony of innerstanding begins to 
unfold.

Not through words, but through presence.

Not through thinking, but through attunement.



To be consciously aware of something is already to be in silent 
dialogue with it.



THE CONSCIOUS CHOISE

**How, then, do we practice this? It begins with the simple 
yet profound act of closing our eyes while fully awake. This act 
is not passive but in most cases a conscious choice—a deliberate decision to 
turn inward. In this context, it doesn’t matter whether free 
will is an illusion or not. The French existentialist Sartre 
says:* 'Even if free will is an illusion, we are still 
responsible for our choices because we experience them as such'.
*Embedded within the operative fabric 
of consciousness is the subjective experience of free will. 
Within that experience, it makes perfect sense to say:* "**I** 
chose to close my eyes. **I** did it."**


*


Where the Attention Goes, the Prana Flows

**Within 
this same realm of choice, we can consciously direct the 
spotlight of our awareness—to our hands, our breath, or any 
other part of our inner world. Whether or not free will is 
ultimately an illusion… isn’t the experience of being able to 
choose where we place our attention a miracle in itself?**


Like nested Chinese boxes, this small miracle of directional 
consciousness reveals yet another hidden within it. Both the 
ancient Indian Tantric and later Chinese Taoist traditions 
recognized this mystery in a shared principle:



*'Where the 
attention goes, the prana (life-energy) flows.'*



Translated through 
the lens of our earlier insights, this prana is not just 
energy—it is also a kind of subtle language, a living form of 
communication capable of harmonizing the untimely, often 
discordant voices in the inner zoo of our being.



So perhaps the old saying deserves a small, contemporary 
flourish:



'Where the attention goes, the prana 
flows... and knows.'



Consciousness adds 
Direction to our Life-Force.

**A transformative 
innerstanding power seems to follow the path set by our conscious choice to 
direct awareness in a certain direction. Consciousness adds 
direction to our life-force. In your daily life, 
practice directing your awareness to different parts of your 
body. Notice how this simple act can invigorate and calm you.
**


Conscious Attention is Love

**Now consider this example: 
offer another human being your undivided and nonjudgmental 
conscious attention. Almost without fail, this person will feel 
uplifted. **


The same principle applies to our own body. In fact, it is vital 
to put this 'oxygen mask' on ourself first. Simple, focused, 
high-quality awareness directed inward enlivens the body and 
even holds the potential to heal. This act of consciously 
choosing where to direct attention unveils the profound 
interconnectedness between awareness and the 'pranic' life-force—a little miracle 
hidden in plain sight.




The first human being we must befriend in vitality is our own 
body, and that friendship begins with conscious awareness 
directed inwards. You, as *'[I' ](/civilization/inner-and-outer-person) *
[must 
befriend *'me*](/civilization/inner-and-outer-person).’ And the path to this connection starts 
with the simplest act: closing your eyes. It’s that simple. Just 
close your eyes and—'BOOM'—you’re already on the path of a 
friendship that will, from there, flow outward, rippling into 
ever-expanding circles.




Strength and Quality of Conscious Awareness

**The inner energetic life of the body is profoundly shaped by 
the strength and quality of our conscious attention. The more 
awareness we direct inward, [the more this inner life responds](/fields/meditative-pixelation), 
growing increasingly dynamic and vibrant. This creates a 
feedback loop: as awareness fuels inner energy, this awakened 
flow, in turn, nourishes and strengthens conscious awareness, 
reinforcing the cycle of deepening presence. **



The Value of Countless Repetitions

**As an electric solo guitarist, I know from experience that 
behind every fluid riff lie countless repetitions—slow, 
deliberate, almost meditative. And yet the intellect, in its 
illusion of superiority, tends to believe that once something 
has been said, it need not be said again. Repetition is 
dismissed as redundancy—its subtle, transformative power 
overlooked. **


That is why I repeat again and again:
[redundancy is a 
virtue](/#The_Importance_of_Repetition) when it comes to lived conscios spirituality. The deeper layers of human innerstanding are like tense 
muscles: they don’t release on command. They need repeated, 
gentle pressure—like massage—to soften, loosen, and eventually 
dissolve their hidden knots. The same is true when trying to 
shift stubborn habits or emotional patterns; transformation 
requires continuous, compassionate nudging.

However, let me clarify that this is different from rumination 
where you run around in a circle or a downward spiral. Add 
conscious awareness and we enter an upward spiral of clarity and 
flow.



Translated into Mirabai’s oceanic language, wisdom is like a 
stone slowly polished by the sea. It is not force, but time, 
contact, and repetition that round its edges and reveal its 
shape.



This is in fact the true meaning 
behind the use of a mantra. This mantra is worth repeating as a 
self-reminder. Gurdjieff referred to it as the practice of* 'constant 
self-remembrance'.* 




Let me now consciously repeat: Consciousness is drawn to change, 
while much of our ancient awareness systems are rooted in 
continuity and repetition. Consider a few examples of such 
natural repetitions—more accurately, pulsations: the heartbeat, 
the morning shit, the breath. These rhythms have accompanied 
life since the time of stardust, endlessly cycling through 
existence. In meditation, the deliberate use of repetition acts 
as a bridge, allowing us to become consciously aware of these 
primal rhythms that have quietly sustained us through the ages 
below the radar of intellect.



The Danish existentialist philosopher Kierkegaard struggled with 
the eternal repetition of mundane life cycles—waking up, eating, 
going to bed, over and over again. His frustration was, 
however, not with the repetition itself, but with the 
unreflective, mechanical repetition of life without conscious 
engagement. He found it absurd and draining, a never-ending loop 
that weighs down the human spirit. Although I’m not a general 
fan of Kierkegaard’s existential labyrinth, I 
still find a lot of gold in his works. Here’s a poignant insight:



*"Of all ridiculous 
things, the most ridiculous seems to me, to be busy — to be a 
man who is brisk about his food and his work. What, I wonder, do 
these busy folks get done?" *(Either/Or, Part I)



Are you and I among 
the busy people Kierkegaard ridicules here? The ones briskly 
rushing from task to task, never pausing to reflect? I must 
admit that, despite all my spiritual work, I too occasionally 
fall into this trap. In modern terms, we call it stress.




While sitting in meditation or during a psychedelic session, you might suddenly realize that 
you’ve been in a state of constant stress without even 
recognizing it. This insight can feel deeply unsettling. And 
that’s one reason why meditation often feels uncomfortable. The 
discomfort doesn’t come from the practice itself, but from its 
remarkable ability to reveal an uncomfortable truth—the frog 
sitting in heating water is, in fact, you and me.



Let me repeat our new mantra: Ordinary consciousness, 
preoccupied with change, often fails to notice ongoing states of 
being because it struggles to detect continuity. In contrast, a 
Zen-trained consciousness, attuned to the steady rhythm of 
awareness, can perceive persistent malaise and respond to it 
with clarity and deliberate action.



By incorporating deliberate repetition in meditation, you 
gradually cultivate the ability to consciously detect repetitive 
patterns within yourself—particularly the insidious rhythm of 
chronic stress. These subtle patterns, unnoticed by the 
untrained mind, operate in the background like a continuous hum 
or rather pressure. 
Meditation trains consciousness to recognize these hidden loops, 
breaking the cycle of unconscious tension and bringing them into 
the light of conscious awareness.



When you become conciously aware of the repetitive undercurrent of stress, 
you gain the power to disrupt it—not by force, but by simply 
noticing its presence. Through this conscious awareness, the cycle starts 
to loosen, and what was once an unconscious burden becomes a 
conscious choice to release.



The Cleansing of Mental Debris in Consciousness****
The next step—repeated a million times—is to consciously engage 
with all bodily sensations in a state of innocent yet deliberate 
'a-ha-conscious' awareness.



Have you ever noticed how difficult it is to capture a natural 
photo of someone who is self-conscious about being photographed? 
The moment we know the camera is on us, we perform. We tense up, 
adjust our posture, and adopt what could metaphorically be 
called "botox lips"—a subtle, forced attempt to control how we 
are perceived.



French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre famously remarked that 
humans are 'condemned to self-consciousness.' His observation 
captures the existential burden of constant self-evaluation—an 
internal performance in which we are both actor and audience. 
This self-awareness is not inherently negative, but it becomes 
burdensome when it spirals into compulsive self-evaluation, 
trapping us in performance rather than presence.



In this context, I reinterpret Sartre’s notion of 
self-consciousness as the 'botox lip' moment—a modern echo of 
the biblical story of Adam and Eve. When they became ashamed of 
their nakedness, they realized their vulnerability after they 
became conscious of their bodies. This marked the birth of 
self-reflection, but also of shame. Shame, at its core, is 
thinking about oneself from the outside in.



Achieving innocence within consciousness is profoundly 
difficult. In modern culture, the performative selfie-era 
attempts to overcome this challenge by postulating that the 
false smile is real, negating the very notion of a true essence. 
Yet, in my view, the absence of essence is not natural—it is a 
byproduct of unresolved conflicts between operative systems 
within us.



The 'Botoxifying' Thinking Process

**Embedded within consciousness, there seems to be a faculty 
designed to analyze and manipulate the external world, and for 
this reason, it inherently lacks innocence. Awareness-systems, 
by contrast, operate instinctively, without intellectual 
understanding, and in this sense, they remain innocent.**


The thought process, residing within the realm of consciousness, 
seeks to take a dictatorial lead over the inner world of 
awareness, always striving to achieve something in the outer 
world. But when it commands us to smile, the smile becomes 'botoxified,' 
stripped of its original, effortless beauty.




The pure mirror of consciousness, the latest blooming flower of 
evolution, has unfolded so closely alongside the evaluating, 
thought-based system that it has formed a near-symbiotic 
relationship. This entanglement causes us to mistakenly equate 
the thinking process with consciousness itself. But they are not 
the same.




It is the thinking machine, embedded within consciousness, that 
has lost innocence.
[
Consciousness, in its essence, is like a mirror](/consciousness/between-nothing-and-something#The_living_Mirror_of_Emptiness_)—untainted by 
what it reflects. In its pure form, it is as innocent as the 
awareness-systems, even though it embodies a different kind of 
innocence.



This innerstanding carries countless implications, but the key 
takeaway is this: for consciousness to merge with awareness, it 
must be cleansed of concepts, words, and understanding. It must 
return to its 'aha-state.'



In meditation, our aim is to transcend the judgmental 
consciousness and return to innocence. And in that innocence, 
consciousness and awareness will spontaneously merge—like 
knights gathered around the round table. This is, in fact, what 
I mean by conscious awareness. It is a deeply symbiotic 
partnership.



The path of inner cleansing is not about adopting another layer 
of performance but about removing the layers 
altogether—returning to a state where 'aha' awareness arises 
naturally, within the mirror of pure consciousness, free from 
force or pretense.



How to Arrest the Thief?

**You might now rightly ask: *Is this cleansing project itself not a 
consequence of a thought process?* Does it not embody the 
very paradox illustrated by [Ramana 
Maharshi’](ramana_and_meditation.htm)s analogy of a 
policeman trying to arrest a thief, aware that he is the thief 
himself?**


Here, I draw inspiration from a powerful insight shared by 
[Nisargadatta Maharaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisargadatta_Maharaj): Conscious, thought-based insights cannot 
create anything primordial. They can only produce symbolic 
representations within the mind. However, while thoughts cannot 
reveal our true nature, they hold immense power over what we 
mistakenly identify as "self"—that is, everything we are not. 
This is the essence of *
[neti neti—"not 
this, not that."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neti_neti)*



When, on a cognitive level, we grasp that we are not confined to 
thoughts, something remarkable happens: thoughts lose their 
grip. They begin to fade, starved of the attention that once fed 
them. And in their gradual dissolution, a deeper reality 
emerges—what was always present but hidden, much like a 
coastline revealing itself as the fog lifts.



This process is not about forcing thoughts into silence. It is 
about recognizing that they are not who we are. The silence 
comes not through suppression, but through 'innerstanding'. In 
that innerstanding, we rediscover what Ramana Maharshi referred 
to as the eternal, unshaken self—clear, vast, and untouched by 
the waves of thought.




In summary, we purify consciousness not by silencing thoughts, 
but by gently and deliberately choosing to place our awareness 
elsewhere. In doing so, we allow consciousness to return to its 
natural mirror-state of innocence—clear, reflective, and 
untainted by the noise of mental narratives.




In fact, I would go so far as to suggest—perhaps 
provocatively—that one fundamental difference between a meditator and a narcissist lies in the ability to see through 
the web of thought, resisting the urge to weave self-reinforcing 
narratives designed to control perception and dominate a 
situation. In this sense, the modern performative selfie culture 
can be seen as a natural offspring of narcissism, where identity 
is curated for external validation. Unconditional self-love is 
here the only anti-dote.



The Lion's Roar

**In the end, conscious awareness is not merely a function of 
the mind—it is a living, even speaking mirror, capable of 
reflecting the silent symphony of our inner life. Through 
simple, repeated acts of conscious attention, we begin to 
reestablish dialogue with the many selves, systems, and 
sensations that inhabit us.**


This is not a return to na&iuml;veté, but to a higher innocence—a 
lucid clarity that arises when we transcend performance and rest 
in a dynamic synthesis of doing and non-doing. In this state, 
awareness and consciousness are no longer separate forces. They 
become allies, weaving a deeper form of presence—one that 
listens while it speaks, feels while it sees, and integrates 
insight through embodied action.



Such presence is not the end of the path but its
[constant ouroboic 
re-beginning](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness). To close one’s eyes, then, is not to 
retreat—but to enter remembrance. And through this remembrance, 
we may finally innerstand the
[
lion’s roar within](papaji_and_meditation.htm#Wake_up_and_Roar_-_A_Divine_fairy_tale)—the ancient, wordless call to truly know 
ourselves.
