Defining the difference between Consciousness and Awareness

DEFINING AWARENESS AND CONSCIOUSNESS**



*We do not live alone, but 
chained to an animal **
from another kingdom: our body.

*Marcel Proust



*Mankind is poised midway between

the gods and the beasts
*Plotinus



At Meditation.dk, our 
exploration of 'awareness' relies on these seemingly straightforward yet 
profoundly nuanced notions: humans as instinctual beings, inextricably linked to 
their bodies. By revisiting familiar landscapes with fresh perspectives, we 
might uncover hidden dimensions previously ignored.




First and foremost, the quest for understanding awareness is an 
inward journey. It is a probing examination of our internal bodily experience. This 
realm is so immediate that we often take it for granted. We exist within the 
dark inner world that lies behind our skin, scarcely acknowledging it. Despite 
being largely overlooked, this inner bodily realm is far from alien.



Before we acknowledge, 
understand and articulate our existence in words, we reside in a 
peculiar inner realm of emotions and an almost infinite 
variation of sensations. Here, our well known emotions are just 
the tip of the iceberg. Beneath them lie even more profound 
layers of life, ancient strata of abstract sensing that regulate 
everything from our heartbeat's cadence to the sinuous movements 
of our digestion. These sensations are hidden in plain sight. 
They transpire in a sort of forgetfulness, akin to a humming 
fridge: It was humming all along, but we only realize this in 
the moment the humming stops.



The Two Forms of Consciousness

**Before venturing further into this murky territory, it's 
important to clarify a fundamental distinction. On 
Meditation.dk, we differentiate between two modes of 
'consciousness': *
[awareness](/consciousness/the-mystery-of-awareness)* and *[
consciousness](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia)*.**


**Close your eyes, and you'll find that a multitude of sensory 
signals emanate from your internal body-space, entering your 
awareness. In this intimate, dimly lit world, you sense rather 
than see. 
This 
experience is distinct from mere interoception;
you're not just attuned to internal sensations but also the 
stimuli at the boundary of your body: your skin. 

With 
eyes closed, you still gain a 'sensed' understanding of your 
surrounding environment. All these sensory inputs coalesce into 
a subjective experience of spatial unity. The inner, sightless 
eye perceives everything as a connected whole. (I will delve 
deeper into this fascinating phenomenon in later chapters.)**


One key takeaway is that this sensory awareness intensifies the 
moment you close your eyes.


Upon reopening your eyes, the proximity of these sensations 
fades. Engaging your eyes shifts your state, making you more 
conscious, but paradoxically less aware of what is going on 
inside of you. Here, consciousness intertwines with the act of 
seeing, grounded in light; awareness is rooted in the process of 
body-sensing, shrouded in darkness.



**In this context, I define 'consciousness' as the brain's 
most recently evolved, fully awake operating system, likely 
accelerated by the advent of human language. It is not 
equivalent with cognition but includes it as a space holder,
[
as a reflective mirror](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia#The_Mirror_and_the_Reflected_).




*As images are seen in a mirror, 
so the universe**
is an image in the mirror of Consciousness.

*Tripura Rahasya XL verses 53-54




This conceptual distinction aligns with Indian mystic 
Nisargadatta Maharaj's views:



*
Awareness is primordial; it is the original state, 
beginningless, endless, uncaused, unsupported, without parts, 
without change. Consciousness is on contact, a reflection 
against a surface, a state of duality.
*
*
There can be no consciousness without awareness, but there can 
be awareness without consciousness, as in deep sleep. Awareness 
is absolute, consciousness is relative to its content; 
consciousness is always of something.**

*
Nisargadatta 
Maharaj - *I AM THAT*



Awareness is 'primordial'. 

Awareness serves as the foundational layer of consciousness. 
From an evolutionary perspective, 
life developed awareness before waking consciousness. In this 
sense awareness consists of the first steps towards develloping 
the biological mirrors that on later stages were able to 
concentrate the light of self-awareness into what we could call 
consciousness.



To distill the 
distinction:



• Awareness immerses in the immediate, 
shadowy domain of sensation. It represents unity and immediacy; 
a realm of dark 'suchness' devoid of traditional understanding. 
Echoing this, Meister Eckhart notes, "*God is pure presence, 
residing solely within Himself*."



• Consciousness embodies luminous cognitive alertness, 
maintaining the duality and distance essential for 
verbal understanding. As Meister Eckhart observes, "*The closer we 
align Him (God) with non-likeness, the better we understand Him*."

In this way we could say that consciousness in fact is awareness 
becoming aware of itself in a gap where awareness splits from 
itself.

*
An infant develops 
best in unlimited attentive close-sensing contact with the 
mother. Sensing awareness develops before consciousness in a 
person. An infant is undifferentiatedly attentive. Consciousness 
only begins to develop along with language at the age of two or 
three. The dog and child in the above illustration are not truly 
consciously awake, but fully aware.*


Dear reader, you may have observed 
an intriguing paradox in the preceding passages. While I 
characterize consciousness as a vessel for pure cognition, I 
simultaneously draw from religious texts to illuminate this 
concept. Consciousness, seen more as a reflective surface rather 
than its contents, encompasses not only pure reason but also 
narrative. Historically, this narrative hasn't always been 
strictly rational. Among the most potent forms of narrative is 
the religious kind, with its unparalleled ability to unify 
people and galvanize them into collective action. Harari 
astutely observes that humans are inherently storytellers, a 
trait distinguishing us from all other creatures. This unique 
capacity intriguingly combines the realms of empirical, 
scientific reason with the often irrational realm of religious 
narrative. As such, I aim to shed light on the enigmatic nature 
of the consciousness 'mirror' by drawing upon both logical 
reasoning and religious tales.



Now it's time to embrace 're-ligare', a Latin term meaning 'to 
reconnect', urging us to return to our roots.



The Deep Roots of 
Awareness

**In Meditation.dk, the term 'awareness' embraces all 
fundamental, latent, and semi-conscious states that predate our 
more recently evolved, fully conscious state, a development that 
may be as recent as 50,000 years ago. *'Awareness'* is an 
encompassing term referring to the processes related to our 
earliest biological origins, reaching back to the times of 
single-celled organisms in the Precambrian waters. (It is 
imperative to have read the inaugural chapter, "[Consiousnes 
& evolution](/consciousness/consciousness-and-evolution)", 
before delving further into this topic.) Given its extensive 
evolutionary timeline, awareness is intricate, resembling a 
patchwork tapestry.**


While these ancient systems differ widely, they possess a shared 
characteristic: They function autonomously, without the need for 
linguistic understanding or expression. Within this domain, one 
might feel as if floating amidst a nebula of nebulous sensory 
stimuli. Each stimulus offers a distinct form of non-linguistic 
communication ans instinct based action, wholly unique in its 
nature. Nevertheless, a few of these systems have acquired 
rudimentary verbal comprehension. This explains why a pep talk 
in front of a morning mirror with affirmations like "I am 
beautiful" or "I am a winner" can be invigorating. However, 
these foundational aspects of our being can't converse using 
words when reaching out to our conscious self. Their 
communication is reminiscent of a perceptive dog: to some extend 
understanding its owner's words but unable to verbalize a 
response. Instead, they resort to their intrinsic modes of 
communication, and the irony is that we often struggle more to 
decode ourselves than understanding dog language.



To illustrate, consider the tension one might experience in the 
ringed muscle around the anus, an area endowed with nerve 
endings from our tailed predecessors. When the age-old monkey 
inside feels threatened, it subconsciously tries to find balance 
with a tail that has long since disappeared. Consequently, many 
of us navigate modern landscapes unknowingly bearing the latent 
tension of ancient primates. While Socrates' famed adage, *'Know 
thyself,'* might not have anticipated this particular nuance, 
numerous individuals move through life with both tight asses and 
stiff upper lips, often oblivious to these deep-rooted 
sensations. (The playful mention of "tight asses" is, in this 
context, a conscious nod to a *Freudian slip*)



The demarcation 
between consciousness and awareness can be thus distilled: 
consciousness interprets through dualistic, remote visual 
perception, while awareness immerses in immediate, unified 
sensing. However, it appears consciousness hasn't grasped the 
reality that we've been existing for eons independently of its 
interpretations. 




This unconsciousness presents a curious paradox: By employing an 
abundance of words in this chapter about awareness, it suggests 
that everything herein is penned from the vantage point of 
consciousness. Awareness cannot author its own tale, just as a
[
hundred monkeys typing away for a century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) wouldn't produce 
any meaningful narrative on the subject.


The Unfathomable and Ancient Proximity of 
Awareness

**We are like trees. What is chronologically farthest from us is closest to 
our core. The older a biological control system is, the closer it is to our 
existence as a cellular living primordial ocean.


Precisely because of this age-related proximity, 
'primitive' sensations and emotions are unconscious but aware. The older the 
layers of attention activated, the closer they are, the less awake we are, and 
the less do we understand them. 




*God is close to us, but we are far from Him. 
**
God is within, but we are outside.

God is at home; we are strangers.

*Meister Eckhart




The Aware but Unconscious 
Body-Animal

**We sense attentively. We feel our sensations. We experience 
in awareness. We become aware of ourselves and the world through 
sensations. Fundamentally, humans are sensing animals in their 
attentive awareness. A dog is just as aware as a human. 
Awareness-based survival responses rule in the twilight 
landscapes, almost unknown to consciousness, between sleep and 
waking. In the gray zones between sleep and waking, countless 
archaic operating systems of awareness live, recycling ancient 
genetic bio-software, making us the living landfill we are, seen 
in loving misanthropy at our core.**


Let us once again delve into Rumi's profound musings on the 
soul's odyssey. Yet, this time, let's interpret his words with 
the remembrance that all these evolutionary soul stages coexist 
within us, here and now:

*
"Originally, you were clay.

From being mineral, you becamet vegetable.

From vegetable you became animal, and from animal, man.

During these periods man did not know where he was going,

but he was being taken on a long journey nonetheless.



And you have to go through a hundred different worlds yet.

I died from minerality and became vegetable;

And from vegetativeness I died and became animal.

I died from animality and became man.

Then why fear disapearance through death?

Next time I shall die Bringing forth wings and feathers like 
Angels.

After soaring higher than angels-

You cannot imagine.

I shall be that."


*

Rumi



THE DUALITY OF SIGHT

**Feeling and 
sensing are intrinsic to our being. Yet, the vast corpus of 
poetic writings worldwide captures only a sliver of the body's 
inner sensory landscape. I dare to say that 90% of our lived 
experience unfolds in the nuanced near-sensing of attentive 
awareness, beyond the purview of consciousness's attempts to 
understand. The intimate non-dual nature of awareness makes it 
difficult for consciousness, with its penchant for distance, to 
interpret the body's internal cues. Just as a painter steps back 
to truly see and appreciate the entirety of their artwork, we 
too must occasionally distance ourselves from the intricacies of 
our lives to grasp the broader strokes of our being.**


Close-range Sensing versus Long-range Perception****

**Close-range sensing, encompassing touch, taste, and smell, 
is primarily governed by our older, more primal systems of 
awareness. In contrast, our most recently evolved waking 
consciousness is closely aligned with long-range or distant 
perception, such as sight and hearing. The sense of sight is 
intimately tied to our state of consciousness, offering us a 
sharp perception of our surroundings. In Danish, being fully 
awake is termed 'lysv&aring;gen,' which aptly translates to 
'light-awake'. **


In the attempt to 
shed light on the letters it is not a good idea to read a book 
with our nose pressed to the pages.
Consciousness 
is always trying to place some distance between itself as the 
observer and the observed. Otherwise we cannot find ourselves 
and we come to resemble
[
Jethro Tull's](https://www.songtell.com/jethro-tull/the-story-of-the-hare-who-lost-his-spectacles) hare that lost its spectacles, unable to 
realize they were perfectly positioned all along.



Cognitive 
Validation of Emotions through Visual Distance

**Sight is frequently heralded as humanity's paramount 
conscious sense, offering a means to validate our internal 
world. Our propensity to privilege visual cues over sensations 
from other senses suggests an intricate interplay between 
consciousness and awareness. This interdependence manifests when 
we seek visual representation of emotions, almost suggesting, '*To 
understand my emotions, I must see them*.' In order to get 
insight, to shed light on a subject, distance is required. This 
visual distance sets the stage for the duality between the 
observer and the observed. **


In this sense the price we pay for understanding ourselves is 
that we get alienated towards ourselves. We can only look at and 
understand ourselves by not being ourselves. That is why we 
close our eyes in meditation. Meditation is the art of temporary 
blinding ourselves in order to find what understanding cannot 
see.



Hence, in order to gain spiritual wisdom (as opposed to 
understanding) the norse god Odin, according to mythology, had 
to sacrifice one eye.



In the same line of thinking Meister Eckhart claims:
'Had I a God whom I could understand, I would no longer hold him 
for God.'
We loose our 
inexplainable nature by explaining it.




'The more we can impute to Him 
(God) not-likeness,

the nearer do we get to understanding Him.'

[Meister Eckhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meister_Eckhart)




The phenomenon of leaning heavily 
on visual cues to process or validate our experiences is, 
however, deeply ingrained in human behavior. Here are some more 
examples:



Several facets of 
human behavior reflect our deep-rooted reliance on visual 
perception: 'Seeing is Believing' - This proverbial wisdom 
underscores that, for many, visual evidence outweighs oral 
testimonials. A picture, they say, is worth a thousand words. In 
this digital age, that might extend to videos being even more 
potent than photographs in affirming truths.



Interestingly, thought formation shares a closer affinity with 
audition; we often 'hear' our internal monologues. Before 
written words, pivotal cultural narratives passed through 
generations via oral traditions. Hearing, thus, operates as an 
ambiverted sense, equally adept at close and long-range 
perception. This versatility of sound elucidates why powerful 
oratories or captivating melodies can penetrate our conscious 
guard and resonate with the intuitive, more primal facets of our 
being. Both spiritual leaders and persuasive orators harness 
this capability, reaching the profound archetypal layers of 
humanity through auditory means. However, the persuasive power 
of voice and sound to seems only to function when there a 
regression of consciousness is happening. This peculiar 
phenomenon can be observed at is fullest in any speech made by 
Hitler.




Humans: A Battlefield for Evolutionary Conflicts****
As explind in the chapter, 

[
Consiousnes & Evolution](/consciousness/consciousness-and-evolution), 
humans are a melting pot of cells and bacteria, hosting diverse 
bio-operating systems ranging from the Precambrian era to now. 
At the convergence of these systems, few communicate through 
language. Some resonate with emotions, while the most ancient 
ones respond solely to sensory input. These inherent temporal 
disparities breed internal conflicts: our primal instincts clash 
with the newly awakened human faculties.

The above Chinese watercolor 
depicts a meditating Zen monk, peacefully seated atop a creature 
that is primitive yet vaguely humanoid. This portrayal is in 
line with a longstanding tradition featuring Buddhas, 
Bodhisattvas, and meditating monks. To symbolize consciousness's 
triumphant victory over animalistic instincts, they are often 
illustrated riding dragons, lions, or tigers. What's perhaps 
unintentionally amusing about this particular watercolor is the 
slightly disgruntled and sidelong glance the creature seems to 
cast, at least to my eyes.

If I were the monk, I'd be wary of resting too confidently on 
this formidable perch. It feels as if the creature is simply 
waiting for an opportunity to topple the monk from his pedestal.



Our newfound, almost microscopic consciousness, is inherently 
fragile at its core. The light of consciousness shines like a tiny 
flame at the end of a matchstick, easily extinguished.



'CONSCIOUS AWARENESS'

*Where Night Learns to Shine and Light Learns to Feel

***Over the course of this chapter we have trekked from the 
dim, pre-linguistic caves of awareness to the dazzling mirrors 
of consciousness, watching each claim sovereignty over our inner 
life. What remains is to articulate how these two powers can be 
married into what I call *'conscious awareness'*. It is a mode in 
which the body’s wordless knowing and the mind’s lucid mirroring 
in pure consciousness operate as a single, seamless faculty. *
Conscious awareness* does not blur the difference between 
sensing and mirroring; it orchestrates them, the way a skilled 
baker folds dark batter into bright icing until swirl becomes 
pattern, pattern becomes cake, and nothing essential is lost.**


Begin with awareness: that oceanic hum of pulse, breath, 
gut-current and cellular murmur. Left on its own, this strata 
governs survival with exquisite economy, yet it cannot name its 
own pain or chart a new course when conditions change. Layered 
above it is consciousness: the quick silver of language, symbol 
and strategic foresight and most of all the quality of pure 
mirroring. Alone, consciousness dazzles but unmoors us, draping 
sterile light over feelings it no longer hears. 'Conscious 
awareness' arises the instant attention is willing to descend 
from the eyes into the flesh while remaining bright, or to put 
it inversely, when sensation is welcomed up into the court of 
clear reflection without being dissected.



Practically, this synthesis feels like holding an inner 
microphone and flashlight at once. Close your eyes, feel the 
diaphragmatic tide, and, without losing that tactile 
intimacy, open a slight crack of inner questioning: What is the 
texture of this breath? What is the mood of this heartbeat? The 
moment a descriptive whisper meets the raw vibration without 
dulling it, conscious awareness blinks on. Nothing theatrical 
occurs; instead, time slows, edges soften, decisions clarify. 
The body senses it is being heard, so its signals grow coherent. 
The mind, relieved of guesswork, drops its compulsive 
commentary. A single bandwidth of experience emerges in which 
meaning and mirror becomes one - and dual - in unity.
