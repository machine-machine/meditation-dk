This chapter marks my early, tentative knocks on the Doors of 
Perception—behind which lies not just one revelation, but an 
infinite unfolding of doors within doors.**



And once again, [forgive me for repeting](/#The_Importance_of_Repetition) certain points.

In an academic context, it would be inappropriate. But here, in 
the realm of *
['innerstanding'](/#The_Importance_of_Repetition)*, 
redundancy is not a flaw—it’s a feature.

Repetition is how depth grows. Truth, in these matters, doesn’t 
arrive in a straight line. It echoes. It loops. It sinks in 
slowly.



In my view, consciousness is one of the most challenging 
phenomena to understand and describe. As a result, this chapter 
is continually revised, and I may never be entirely satisfied 
with it.




*'Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive 
phenomenon.

it is 
impossible to specify what

it is, what it does, or why it evolved.

Nothing worth reading has been written 
about it.'

*Stuart Sutherland


Since childhood, I have been obsessed with the question: *Who 
and what am I?* I began to ponder this with crossed legs at the tender age of 
3 after a tourist visit with my parents to a Buddhist temple in Burma. After 
that visit, I began to sit and meditate, as you can see in the photo below.



![](/images/GunnarHongKong.jpg)






The mystery of *who am I?***


*'When you gaze long into 
an abyss, **
the abyss also gazes into you.'

*Nietzsche



After a lifetime of self-inquiry, one truth stands out: consciousness can be 
examined only by consciousness itself.



So which is it?

Am I watching consciousness—

or is consciousness watching me?



Nietzsche called that reflective stare an abyss because an abyss is unknowable; 
it looks back and offers nowhere firm to stand.




Consciousness is the primal, silent field in which every experience 
appears—including the experience we call 'consciousness.'




Yet it hides in plain sight. As [Kabir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabir) 
laughed: *I smile when I hear the fish in the ocean are crying for water.* 


What is 'redness'?****
*'What is 'redness?' *A young drunk university student 
asked me this question at a party in my youth. I was also drunk, 
but nevertheless we forgot all the beautiful girls around us 
while trying to solve that question.

*

*From ancient times to today, no one has offered a truly 
satisfactory answer.

And the mystery deepens when we ask: what within us perceives 
redness?

Whatever perceives it must exist prior to the experience of red.

And what, then, perceives perception itself?




Consciousness is the mystery within which the mystery of 
perception arises—

and within that, the mystery of redness unfolds.
It’s like Chinese boxes within Chinese boxes, or the old myth of 
Atlas holding the world while standing on a tortoise... and 
[what 
holds the tortoise?](/what-is-meditation#The_Potato_Sack_)



Still, we use the word consciousness in daily conversation as if 
it were the most obvious thing in the world—as if we all agreed 
on its meaning.



But first, we should humbly admit: we do not know.

And yet, we stretch the term to cover everything from gender 
consciousness to class consciousness to racial 
consciousness—without ever truly asking what consciousness is. 
We are consious about this and that, but we are not conscious 
when it comes to consciousness.





Consciousness was groomed to look out

** 
Even 
when examined through the lens of evolutionary biology, 
consciousness and especially self-consciousness remains a 
mystery. What benefit does it provide? What role does it play in 
evolution? In principle, could we not function perfectly well 
without it? Do 'super-conscious' people achieve a reproductive 
edge in the Darwinian game? Hardly.**


Throughout history, society’s spiritual luminaries—saints, 
ascetics, and sages—have tended to live on the margins and have 
rarely excelled at survival and reproduction. Shiva, the Hindu 
deity of meditation, is traditionally depicted without progeny. 
Wise sages are rarely celebrated for their genetic legacy. 
Meister Eckhart, a Dominican friar, took a vow of 
celibacy—typical of many spiritual paths that prioritize 
transcendence over reproduction.




This apparent evolutionary 
dead-end of higher consciousness—particularly among sages and 
mystics who reject reproduction—poses a challenge to classical 
Darwinian logic. Some, like Bret Weinstein, argue for 
group-level evolutionary advantages in such traits. Others, like 
Richard Dawkins, firmly reject this, insisting that natural 
selection works only at the level of genes.

I do not align with either view. My point is simply this: 
self-reflective consciousness, especially in its spiritual 
expressions, resists easy placement within any known 
evolutionary framework. Perhaps this is because its origin and 
function lie beyond the evolutionary logic altogether.



However,
Darwinism still offers a likely explanation for our surprising lack of 
conscious self-knowledge: consciousness evolved to face outward, 
constantly scanning for threats and opportunities that improve 
our chances of survival.



Indeed, from an evolutionary perspective, it can even be 
beneficial to overestimate what we know, a tendency that 
flourishes in less-awake minds. 




*'The more unintelligent a man is, 


the less mysterious existence seems to him.'
*
Arthur Schopenhauer



This peculiar mental ossification is known as the 
[Dunning Kruger 
effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect). A relentlessly self-questioning ego might burn 
through calories long before a confidently mistaken one.



There was little evolutionary advantage in turning the spotlight 
inward—until, perhaps, today. In our current age of rapid social 
and technological complexity, inward-looking self-aware 
consciousness might finally offer an evolutionary edge.



Roosevelt and Socrates

** In order to give space to other 
boxes of realities than our own, first of all, we must realize 
that we do not know much. Socrates proclaimed:* I seem, then, in 
just this little thing to be wiser than this man at any rate, 
that what I do not know I do not think I know either. *More than 
2000 years later, Roosevelt said: *Never underestimate a man who 
overestimates himself. *Maybe the most dangerous overestimation 
is created in the unawareness of what we do not know. In fact, 
the world is, to a large extent, ruled by such mindsets. 





**

SCIENCE AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS CONUNDRUM**





*Every science is function of the psyche, and all knowledge is 
rooted in it. **
The psyche is the greatest of all cosmic wonders and is the *
sine qua non*

of the world as an object. It is the highest degree odd that 
Western man,

with but a few - and ever fewer - exceptions, apparantly pays so 
little regards

to this fact. Swamped by the knowledge of external objects, the 
subject of all

knowledge has been temporarily eclipsed to the point of seeming 
nonexistence.

*C.G.Jung - On the Nature of the Psyche, 1946



For years, I struggled to read mainstream science's take on 
consciousness—it seemed too simplistic. The following excerpt 
from Wikipedia illustrates the issue, as science unwittingly 
reduces consciousness to primitive neurophysiological processes 
in the brain:





[

![](/images/NeuralCorrelates.jpg)

](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness)


*The illustration is borrowed 
from Wikipedia, where the image is predictably titled "Neural 
Correlates OF Consciousness" in a Western context. In the chosen 
Eastern perspective presented here, I would like to rephrase it 
as: "Neural Correlates IN Consciousness."*




However, this explanation is just 
as insufficient as measuring the frequency of the red color 
spectrum to understand what redness is. But science is 
satisfied; a measurement has been made.



**The image titled '*Neural Correlates of Consciousness*' 
would be better phrased as '*Neural Correlates in Consciousness*.' 
Describing consciousness as a product of neural correlates is 
like defining a mirror by the content reflected in it. **


When science claims it can explain everything within old-school 
positivism's paradigms, it effectively replaces religious 
storytelling with new fairy tales. The scientist, in this case, 
becomes a priest. A fundamental fact is that no person, 
including scientists, can remove themselves as emotionally 
fragile, human observers from the scientific equation. Like 
anyone else, they'll interpret facts in sync with their own or 
their clan's survival.




The Uncharted Territory of 
Consciousness in Western Science****
Time and again, it amazes me how nearly every Westerner, from 
the layperson to the scientist and philosopher, uses the term '*consciousness*' as if it were a known entity. The Western, 
positivist-trained mind tends to quantify consciousness in terms 
of measurement, without realizing that they have no real 
understanding of what consciousness truly is. Consciousness is 
often either downplayed in importance or relegated to dead-end 
measurements.



When it comes to the enigma of consciousness, our collective 
unknowing is almost absurd. Let me repeat: We fundamentally 
don't know what consciousness is, and the wisest approach would 
be to acknowledge our ignorance.



This blind spot—the failure to recognize our own ignorance—is, 
ironically, a product of unconsciousness itself.



We are, quite literally, unconscious of our unconsciousness.



The scientific mind in the West is brilliant when it comes to 
identifying and defining what is known, but often falters when 
it comes to treating not-knowing with the same rigor and care.



The Case of Dawkins

**I’m always struck when
[Richard 
Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins)—a thinker whose intelligence and wit I admire—speaks 
with sweeping authority about 'religion' and 'God' yet never 
pauses to define, with scientific precision, which God or which 
form of religion he is rejecting.**


What God, exactly, is he dismissing?

Which religion is he dismantling?



He excels at exposing the flaws of institutional dogma. But when 
it comes to the deeper mystical, contemplative, or metaphysical 
streams—Vedanta, Sufi gnosis, Meister Eckhart’s negative 
theology—he seems to treat them as epistemic noise, unworthy of 
serious inquiry.



Does Dawkins possess anywhere near the same familiarity with 
these inner sciences of consciousness as he does with 
evolutionary biology? Or is he, perhaps unknowingly, comparing 
apples to oranges—judging profound first-person disciplines by 
the standards of third-person measurement?



In short, armed with a Socratic question:

Does Dawkins know that he doesn’t know?



Probably not—because anything that falls outside the empirically 
testable domain is, for him, simply non-knowledge. And so an 
entire continent of insight remains invisible to one of our 
era’s brightest minds.



The *Hard Problem* of Science

**However, modern brain science has become more aware of the gap 
between measurements and the phenomenological experience, the *
[qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia)*. They call it the*
[
'hard problem.'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness)***


The hard problem of consciousness lies in the explanatory gap 
between physical processes and our experience of them within the 
framework of neuroscience. Physical processes, such as 
perceiving a red circle, can be broken down into a series of 
simpler problems relating the physical object (i.e., color and 
form) to the brain processes responsible for processing them. 
Similarly, the perception of more complex forms, such as a 
house, can be broken down into a series of hierarchically 
organized brain processes in the visual cortices that add 
increasing complexity to the visual construct that eventually 
emerges as a house. These processes, which together compile the 
visual construct of the house, can be considered a series of 
building blocks from a reductionist perspective - a series of 
simpler problems.



The hard problem of consciousness arises because the subjective 
experience of that house cannot be logically arranged on such a 
continuum. There is no known brain process at the end of the series of 
processes responsible for the experience of the house, thus 
breaking the chain of logic. This also raises the question of 
the purpose of experience. Why do we have subjective 
experiences? Brain research can provide a very precise 
explanation down to the square millimeter of tissue responsible 
for perceiving the color red, but it can say surprisingly little 
about how red is experienced. It seems that the brain has all 
the mechanisms to make the physical world available to human 
experience, but the experience itself is not part of the same 
system.





One of my favorite scientific voices, Sabine Hossenfelder, 
recently claimed that the mystery of redness—the subjective 
experience of the color red—has now been solved.








Science, she says, can now 
precicely measure 
how the brain perceives redness. For the first time, it can 
quantify qualia.



I politely, but firmly, disagree.



Yes, we may now identify specific brainwave signatures that 
correlate with the experience of the color red. But that tells 
us nothing about how these signals are translated into the 
vivid, inner subjective experienced sensation of redness—what it feels like to see red, 
not t speak about what abyss percieves these feelings. 




The hard problem of consciousness remains untouched.



And here’s what amazes me: scientists like Sabine Hossenfelder 
and Richard Dawkins—people who 
are, without question, ten times more intelligent than I am in 
their domain—somehow don’t seem to notice this gap.




Knowing the Unknown****
What do I see, then?



I’m no expert in neuroscience. In fact, I’m comparatively 
ignorant 
when it comes to hard science. But I see its limits with the 
clarity of a falcon in flight.



Let me revise my favorite line from Socrates: *'I seem, then, in just this little thing to be wiser than 
these scientists at any rate: that what I do not know, I do not 
think I know.'

*

Science can measure patterns in the brain when we perceive the 
color red.

But it cannot explain what it feels like to see red.



Perhaps there’s a kind of evolutionary trade-off at play.

Just as we may have sacrificed parts of our memory to evolve 
language,

perhaps the brain regions that support precise scientific 
analysis have develloped on the cost of the regions that 
perceive the limits of that ability.



In our hunger for certainty and survival,
we may have dulled the ancient Socratic muscle that says:




*'Stop. You don’t know.'*




To be a scientist and to see the 
boundaries of science—these may be two fundamentally different capacities of mind.




For me, *knowing what I don't know* is more important than knowing 
what I do know. 


This special awareness allows me to consciously recognize the 
limits of my knowledge in any given subject.



Clarity emerges as 
a byproduct of expanded consciousness when we perceive it as a 
function of our ability to process information. As consciousness 
grows through experiencing larger amounts of data, we become 
aware of the darkness and the grey zones between darkness and 
light.



A Nobel scientist may have underdeveloped faculties for what I 
call Socratic consciousness, while a deeply conscious individual 
might not even score above average on a standard IQ test.

That’s because consciousness likely draws on entirely different 
neural circuitry than the kind of intelligence shaped and 
celebrated by the Western educational model.



Over the years, I’ve met people with exceptional IQs and high 
emotional intelligence (EQ), yet they lacked what I refer to as 
MQ—Metaconsciousness Quotient: the capacity for a consciousness 
that is consciously aware of itself.



This is the essence of what I mean by Socratic consciousness—the 
ability to know that one does not know, and to remain lucid 
within that unknowing.



Yet MQ has much more to offer. That’s why I’ve devoted an entire 
chapter to this subtle and recursive phenomenon, which I call *
'[Ouroboros Consciousness](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness)'.*




Is Consciousness Equal to 
Having an Experience?

**In recent years, science, psychology, and philosophy have 
made meaningful strides in exploring consciousness. I won’t dive 
deeply into that body of work here, but I do recommend 

[Annaka 
Harris’s excellent book Conscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annaka_Harris), 
which gathers some of the most refined contributions from 
contemporary Western thought into a lucid and accessible 
bouquet. In line with the prevailing Western view, Harris 
essentially defines consciousness as the capacity to have an 
experience.**


Beyond Experience

**But now, I’d like to introduce a more radical proposition:**
Not even the elusive phenomenon of subjective experience has 
anything to do with consciousness.



Even more mysterious than what science calls qualia is the 
simple fact that qualia appear at all—that there is a field in 
which they arise. To reduce consciousness to experience would, 
in the eyes of Indian mystics, be absurd. It would be like 
claiming that a mirror is made of the reflections it holds.



When I meditate with young people, they often describe all kinds 
of internal experiences—flashes of light, waves of sound, 
intricate visions, even states akin to psychedelia. Then they 
ask me:

*'And what did you experience?'

*I reply, simply:

*'Nothing.'

*

Here lies the paradox:



As long as you are having an experience, you have not yet 
touched consciousness.



Inner experiences are not the goal of meditation—they are 
distractions to be transcended.



Experience is an event, a movement, a content.

Consciousness is that primordial mystery in which all content appears—and yet which 
remains utterly untouched by it. True consciousness is not what 
is seen, felt, or known.
It is the ungraspable field in which all such things arise and 
dissolve.



In deeper meditative traditions—especially in *[Advaita 
Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta)* and *
[Dzogchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzogchen)*—consciousness 
is not something that experiences, but rather the space in which 
experience arises, and which may be most fully present only when 
experience has ceased.



On this point, I align completely with those traditions:

Pure awareness is not defined by its contents, but by its 
boundless capacity to contain them.




Generally, I avoid framing history primarily through the lens of 
colonialism. Yet I can’t help but marvel at the scientific 
hubris of the West: confidently theorizing about consciousness 
while barely dipping a toe into the millennia-deep contemplative 
traditions of the East.




The Wisdom of Knowing Unknowing**




*When consciousness turns 
inward, there is a sensation of not-knowing. **
When it turns outward, that which can be known is created.

*Nisargadatta Maharaji




Life has taught me one tough 
lesson: it's good to know something. As Warren Buffet says, *The 
more you learn, the more you earn*.

However, it's even better to learn what you have *not* learned.
I always strive to know what I don't know, so I don't risk 
diving into discussions or projects where




I'm out of my depth, 
thinking I'm an expert. Roosevelt's famous words, *'Never 
underestimate a person who overestimates themselves,' *primarily 
remind me to be aware of my ignorance. It's so frustrating to 
talk to someone who hasn't factored in their own lack of 
knowledge.



Recognizing one's limitations is wisdom. A wise and knowledgeable person seeks 
an expanded overview that encompasses their own and others' 
subjectivity as part of the bigger picture. This objectification 
is inherently subjective but remains an essential pursuit in the 
eternal search for what is true enough. We may never grasp the 
*'[thing-in-itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself)'*, but we can always come closer to something 
truer than yesterday's truth.

When the persuit of coming closer to today's truth is followed 
by a growing realization of what we do not know, it for me is a 
sign of an expanding Consciousness. Meister Eckhart says:




*In Unknowing Knowing, We Know 
God.*




I will in this context dare to reformulate my favorite 
mystic: *In Knowing Unknowing, We Know 
God.*




Knowing Not-knowing is wisdom.



We're neck-deep in ignorance**




*The fundament upon which all our knowledge 
**
and learning rest is inexplicable.
*Arthur Schopenhauer


The first and foremost thing to 
'unknow' is consciousness:



We don't know what consciousness is, but are we aware that 
we don't know it?



I claim that meditation expands consciousness, but I don't know 
what consciousness is.



We're unknown to ourselves, often without realizing it...

Truly the most wonderfully absurd self-overestimation.



We know the world but don't know the knower, and we're unaware 
of it...

Truly the greatest joke of all existence.




Discovering this astonishing ignorance is the first, and perhaps 
the most significant, step we can take. Receding knowledge makes 
way for growing wisdom.




The Cost of 
Consciousness****
My digital counterpart, GPT-4, appears to lack consciousness but 
can compose sophisticated essays effortlessly. This seeming 
'unconsciousness of consciousness' might be attributed to its 
lack of Darwinian utility, especially in the primal sense of 
gathering resources. Evolutionary systems prioritize energy 
efficiency, and the metabolic cost of equipping organisms with 
self-reflective consciousness would be prohibitively high.

From this perspective, even rudimentary forms of consciousness 
seem superfluous and inexplicable as products of natural 
selection. Rigorous empirical science struggles to identify any 
survival benefits conferred by consciousness. Why would genes 
gain an evolutionary edge by acquiring awareness? Might not 
artificial, yet unconscious, entities prove just as capable in 
the evolutionary race as conscious biological beings? While some 
argue that metacognition is crucial for survival, this 
self-reflective capacity might not necessarily require 
consciousness; it could be just an advanced feedback mechanism, 
a feature already present in artificial intelligence systems.



Consciousness as the Crown of Unfoldment ** 
**

**Contrastingly, the spiritual sage 
[Nisargadatta Maharaj](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Nisargadatta_Maharaj), an 
illiterate cigar merchant from Bombay, posits that the very 
purpose of existence is to expand, preserve, and amplify 
consciousness. **


In his footsteps I dare to take a leap in pure 'innerstanding':




The emergence and complexity of 
consciousness are natural consequences of intricate 
self-referential systems. The human brain, with its astounding 
internal connectivity that surpasses even the number of 
particles in the universe, represents the epitome of such 
complex systems.




Given its intricate nature, the human brain is perhaps the most 
energy-intensive biological phenomenon we know of. Why then does 
it exhibit a higher form of consciousness than its simpler 
animal predecessors? Personally, I am disinclined to dismiss 
consciousness as a mere evolutionary aberration. Although I 
can't offer a logical proof for this conviction, it aligns with 
Nisargadatta's perspective, rendering the opposing notion—that 
consciousness is meaningless—equally a matter of belief.




Consciousness is in fact Scrödinger's cat. Is it dead or 
alive or both?

**The notion that consciousness is akin to Schrödinger's cat—a 
thought experiment in quantum mechanics where a cat is both 
alive and dead until observed—captures the enigmatic qualities 
of consciousness itself. Like the cat in the box, consciousness 
presents a paradox, existing in a superposition of states that 
evade easy categorization.





**
A CAT FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION**




*No problem can be solved from the same **
level of consciousness that created it.

*Albert Einstein




I recently read 
[Holger Bech Nielsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Bech_Nielsen) and Jonas Kuld Rathje's 
excellent book,* 'The Theory of Everything,' *with great 
enthusiasm. Bech Nielsen describes how inhabitants of a 
two-dimensional world would experience the visit of a cat from a 
three-dimensional reality. (I cannot help pondering if this cat 
should belong to Schrödinger but that is, in fact, irrelevant to 
the story.) First, the two-dimensional beings 
would see four black circles, followed by a large oval blot that 
eventually shrinks to a small black dot on one side of the oval.



As I read this passage, I wondered why the cat's experience of 
the same visit wasn't also examined. The mutual experience of 
the two dimensions encountering each other is the perfect 
illustration of consciousness visiting our lower three-dimensional 
reality. We can't understand consciousness for the same reasons 
the two-dimensional inhabitants couldn't understand the cat. 
Consciousness is a guest from a reality with more dimensions 
than our space-time reality possesses.




Science's attempt to understand consciousness as a product of 
mathematical algorithms is subject to the same conditions as the 
inhabitants of the two-dimensional world trying to understand 
the cat from the three-dimensional space. It's almost touchingly 
comical.




During my college years, on a wet night out, I was presented 
with the following challenge: create four equilateral triangles 
with six matches.









![](/images/taendstik6.jpg)







![](/images/taendstikpyramide.jpg)






The Puzzle of Higher Dimensions

**I tried and tried, unsuccessfully, to solve the 
riddle until the owner of the matches elegantly arranged them into a pyramid. 
Habitually, I had searched for a solution in a two-dimensional plane, where no 
solution was possible. Only by introducing an extra height dimension was a 
solution possible, and in such a simple way that I had to shake my head in 
disbelief.





![](/images/conscioussvisitor.jpg)


** Consciousness: A Visitor from Higher 
Dimensions

**Anyone who has experienced an eureka 
moment in meditation or even psychedelics will instinctively understand the impossibility of 
translating the reality of a multi-dimensional world into a 'lower' dimension. 
Just as with the matchstick puzzle, the extra dimension means an impossible 
problem can be solved in a simple way. For those of you who have not had such an 
experience, this may sound like nonsensical gibberish, but don't despair. 
Nowadays, it's possible to catch a glimpse of realities that are impossible or 
extremely difficult to translate into our familiar world through the use of 
entheogens. One of my friends said after an ayahuasca journey to Peru: *I 
could write an entire book about just one second on this inner journey. A second 
was like a thousand years.***


We will be unaware of any dimension higher than the three we know. We would not 
be able to understand it.



Every human brain is in this sense a portal to where dimensions have a peep into 
a lower realm. We live in a four dimension world.

What does not make sense in our narrow dimension of space-time might make 
obvious sense in higher dimensional realities. I guess most people who have 
tried pschedelics would agree with me on that point.


May I suggest a way of looking at it here: It may 
be that these four dimensions are apearing to us while we are embedded in higher 
dimension realities. 


H****yper 
Dimension

**The human intellect is not sufficient to decode the universe it lives in.**


To the extent that we, as biological beings in time and space, want to explore 
our own consciousness, we are subject to the same conditions as the scientist 
trying to capture the spirit in a bottle in their test tube. It's quite fair and 
square, as long as we remember to acknowledge all that we don't know. This 
humility makes knowledge a subset of wisdom, not the other way around. Without 
this meta-wisdom, the positivistic scientist, in their self-imagined certainty, 
becomes what they have historically fought against since the Middle Ages: a 
preacher of religion.



We can simplify this concept. To thoroughly grasp an entity, we need to surpass 
its level of complexity. Thus, when Buddhists and Vedantists debate whether 
reality is void (shunya) or embodies a soul (Atman, Brahman), they are 
essentially pondering over the nature of the aforementioned cat. This applies to 
any discourse about consciousness as well. The only humble approach is to 
acknowledge our ignorance fully. From this mature vantage point of humility, 
realizing our confinement within a specific dimensional framework, we can debate 
anything more complex than ourselves.



By leaving the flock, one becomes outstanding**


*The object of life is not to be 
on the side of the majority,

but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.

*Marcus Aurelius




We humans are outstanding in the sense that we are aware that we are human. 
Therefore, there must be something unknown within us that has already 
transcended our human standpoint. In this unknown dwells the invisible 
consciousness that both is and is not.



Just as a dog doesn't know it's a dog, consciousness cannot know itself until it 
has risen above itself. Only by transcending the state one is in can one see 
where one came from. A simple example of this can be seen in the meta-conscious 
aha moment when one suddenly realizes that they were on the wrong track.



Only by leaving oneself can one recognize oneself. Only those who are strangers 
to themselves can see themselves. Only the outsider can find himself inside.



And what does he find?



I leave the answer to my favorite mystic:





*
'I sometimes say, if a man who seeks nothing finds nothing,

what has he to
complain?
After all, he has found what he sought.'

*
Meister Eckhart
