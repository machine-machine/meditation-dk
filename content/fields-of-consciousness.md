FIELDS 
OF CONSCIOUSNESS**

Much of the content that follows cannot be substantiated by current 
physics or validated through mathematics. It is, instead, an 
attempt to impose structure upon the experiences I've amassed 
through a lifetime of meditation. This is not an academic 
exercise, not a scholastic debate akin to pondering the number 
of angels that can dance on the head of a pin. My aim is to give 
form to those subtle, subjective experiences that tend to 
dissipate under the rigid lens of scientific scrutiny, the kind 
that cannot be pinned down in a laboratory setting. I am not 
alone in these experiences; there are likely others who will 
find a familiar echo in these words. **


Quantum physics is often appropriated in overly simplistic terms 
by new age spiritualists, inviting derision from scientists with 
a positivist bent. Yet, every technological breakthrough from 
the dawn of civilization has served as a means for us to 
articulate and expand our understanding of the world. Inventions 
are not just practical tools but also additions to our 
conceptual lexicon. The creation of throwable weapons, 
'projectiles,' gave rise to the notion of 'projects'—endeavors 
of the imagination.



Thus, Meditaton.dk's allusions to quantum physics and 
mathematics are intended purely as metaphorical projectiles. In 
this vein, I invoke Einstein's sentiment: 

*"Imagination is 
more important than knowledge.

For knowledge is limited to all 
we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the 
entire world, and all there ever will be to know and 
understand." *


Allow me therefore to reiterate a crucial point for both my own 
reflection and the reader's consideration: the thoughts 
expressed herein stem solely from my intuition and imagination. 
So, let us set sail 
on an odyssey of imagination to probe the essence, not of 
consciousness as *
['ding an 
sich'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself)*, but of footprints in the snow
left
[
by the unseen guest.](/consciousness/between-nothing-and-something#The_Enigmatic_Buddhas_Footprints_)






THE INTENSITY, QUALITY AND RADIUS OF CONSCIOUSNESS****
At the heart of it, a human individual radiates within a 
communal consciousness woven by the union of countless cells 
within our bodies and brains. This cellular confederation 
orchestrates a more focused manifestation of consciousness.



*The Thousand Petalled Lotus* in the Human Brain

**As discussed in detail in the chapter 




[The Ouroboros Consciousness](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness),
our brain and body together function as a lens, 
concentrating the diffuse, eternal, omnipresent consciousness 
that pervades all. Within this vast Brahmanic field, human 
consciousness folds back upon itself in feedback loops, 
transforming the minuscule human awareness into a 
self-recognizing entity that sparkles like a celestial body in 
the firmament of dormant consciousness. This diminutive yet more 
luminous beacon is what Eastern spiritual practices have named 
the *Thousand Petalled Lotus*. A similar enfolding of 
consciousness may also transpire in higher primates and could 
soon be conceivably present in sophisticated AI systems.

![](/images/atmanlotusses.jpg)


The more complex and capable of 
feedback a system is, the more consciousness it can extract from 
the omnipresent primordial pan-consciousness that seems to 
accompany all

[
wavefunctions that have collapsed in matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse). 
In this context, human consciousness acts as an observer in a 
universe that is already observed by an incredibly powerful 
entity, capable of maintaining a state of primordial 
pan-consciousness. [This pan-consciousness](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness) is subtle and 
pervasive but lacks self-awareness. In contrast, human 
consciousness is potent but localized, with the potential for 
exponential self-awareness through feedback loops.**


The human brain-body system, with its intricate complexity and 
exceptional feedback capabilities, can harness and concentrate 
primordial consciousness into a light much more intense than the 
faint illumination of divine omnipresence.
In this sense, god is unconscious 
consciousness, and man is 'his' possibility to wake up.




This fundamental aspect of 
divinity is mostly overlooked by atheists. However, Occam's 
razor suggests the simplest explanation for the phenomenon of 
humanity's obsession with various gods throughout history. 
Instead of the atheistic or traditional religious viewpoints, consider the idea that the 
concept of god is an imaginative and delicate mirror in which 
humans project their highest potential for self-awareness. In 
this perspective, god is an accelerating force of consciousness, 
created by human brains.






As a child, I believed in Santa 
Claus. Today, I consider myself a child of conscious 
consciousness. Meister Eckhart asserts that what holds true for Jesus 
Christ also applies to every good and noble person. Only a noble 
person can peer through the mirror of mirrors. However, such a 
statement was considered heretical, leading to his 
'cancellation' by the Inquisition. Thank god that 
consciousness today not (yet) is a trigger word. 




The Intensity and Radius of Consciousness

**Various elements, including age, health, intelligence, and 
cultural background, can significantly influence the intensity 
of our wakeful consciousness. In observing both myself and 
others, it's evident that consciousness levels fluctuate. At 
times, we exhibit heightened consciousness, while at others, we 
are less aware. The spectrum of consciousness among individuals 
is also diverse, ranging from those with intense but narrowly 
focused consciousness, limited to the confines of their physical 
being, to those possessing a broad consciousness capable of 
empathizing with others' pain, even across different cultural or 
tribal divides. However, this broader consciousness does not 
necessarily facilitate change if it lacks intensity.**


SPIRALING RINGS OF *'ME' & 'MINE'*

**The metaphor of the "*Rings of Me and Mine*" 
captures the concentric nature of human consciousness, with each 
successive ring representing an expanded state of awareness and 
inclusivity. Within each circle lies what we intimately identify 
as 'me and mine,' which we tend to with meticulous care. 
Conversely, what falls outside our designated ring is deemed 
'not me and mine,' placing it beyond our sphere of 
responsibility and consciousness.**


While numerous additional rings could be 
conceived based on various criteria, the key insight remains 
that the extent of our consciousness is determined by the 
boundaries we set around what we claim as ours. We often neglect 
the consciousness that resides in 'the other,' failing to 
acknowledge it until there is an overlap of our realms of 
responsibility. Consequently, our awareness and knowledge of 'the 
other' remain minimal unless they pose a potential threat to our 
'me and mine,' or we perceive an opportunity to acquire 
something from them to call our own. In this view, living 
systems have been expropriating energy — calories — from one 
another since life's inception.



Yet, through a 'Promethean' lens of inherent optimism, I 
perceive us as conduits for burgeoning consciousness, on an 
anti-enthropian path from fragmentation towards unity, from 
rejection to the rejection of rejections. Meister Eckhart 
encapsulates this when he says:


"All creatures 
contain one reflection: one, that is the denial of its being the 
other; the highest of the angels denies he is the lowest.

God is 
the denial of denials."

Meister Eckhart






Individual Body Consciousness

**

![](/images/individualconsciousness.jpg)

**

**At the core of our consciousness lies the primary physical 
consciousness, a realm where awareness is intimately entwined 
with the physical self. This foundational level of consciousness 
is deeply rooted in self-preservation and the desire for 
well-being. In this primal sphere, consciousness is anchored in 
the "I-am-ness" of the body. This intimate association 
with the body shapes our earliest understanding of who we are. 
It is vividly manifested in the way we refer to our physical 
aspects – our arms, legs, and the entire body – using possessive 
terms like 'my'. In defining the borders of consciousnness 
though the word 'me' and 'mine' our attention span rapidly 
decreases as soon as something is identified as not 'mine'. This 
linguistic choice underscores a profound sense of personal 
ownership and consciousness primal connection to our physical 
form.**


Seen in this light the body is not just a physical structure but 
a vessel of identity and existence defined by the circle of our 
conscious attention span. 





Immediate Family and Environment Consciousness

**

![](/images/familyconsciousness.jpg)

**
In the next concentric circle of consciousness, our sense of 
'me and mine' extends to encompass our immediate surroundings. 
Predominantly, this includes the people closest to us – our 
family and friends. In this sphere of consciousness, personal 
emotional responses are more pronounced; we may find ourselves 
deeply affected by the loss or suffering of a family member or a 
close friend, while the troubles of distant others or widespread 
human tragedies might not impact us as strongly.



This level also extends to personal belongings and spaces, 
evidenced by phrases like 'my phone', 'my car', 'my home', and 
'all my belongings'. These possessions and spaces are seen as 
prosthetic¨extensions of ourselves, often holding significant 
emotional or practical value. For instance, one might invest 
considerable effort in making a representable home or managing a 
business, viewing these endeavors as reflections of their 
personal identity. At this stage, the citywall of consciousness 
is built with the notion of not-me and not-mine, marking a clear 
demarcation between what is intimately connected to the self and 
what lies beyond that personal sphere of ownership.*

*


Enhanced Tribal, Community, and National Consciousness

**

![](/images/tribalconsciousness1.jpg)

**


This exploration delves into the third concentric circle of 
awareness, which spans a collective dimension often recognized 
as tribal or community awareness. This layer embodies an 
augmented sense of self that encompasses broader groups beyond 
just our immediate relatives and acquaintances. In this sphere, 
a person deeply involved in an organization, such as a mafia 
member, may possess intense and honorable sentiments towards 
their group, yet paradoxically, exhibit no guilt in harming the 
children of adversaries. This duality is embedded in our ancient 
genetic makeup, equipping us to become warriors in times of 
conflict, capable of confronting others who, under different 
conditions, might be considered comrades.

This realm of tribal awareness 
gradually evolves into the concept of national consciousness. 
Here, the connection to one's nation can intensify to the extent 
that, in dire situations, individuals might willingly sacrifice 
their lives for their country.






SHARED FIELDS 
OF CONSCIOUSNESS

**Let us now zoom 
out and observe the human capacity in 
nurturing extensive pools of collective awareness from a higher 
level of abstraction. From 
friendships to families, clans, tribes, and nations, the sphere 
of concentrated human consciousness expands, encompassing 
broader circles of internal empathy.**


It's crucial to acknowledge that these expanded realms 
of awareness, by their very nature, are linear and consequently 
manifest a persistent barrier of denial and polarization, now 
manifesting in broader circles of 'us versus them'.




This inherent tendency is likely a result of genetic 
predispositions, with our social bonding mechanisms remaining 
essentially unchanged since our days on the East African 
savannas. Our brains, still attuned to Stone Age life, are 
designed for survival within the realms of individuals, 
families, friends, and tribes.



Compassion extended no further 
until the advent of language. As noted by historian 
[Yuval Noah 
Harari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari), humans are inherently storytellers. Language 
facilitated the formation of connections extending beyond small 
tribal groups, primarily with those sharing a common language 
and stories. As history progressed, warfare and commerce became 
pivotal in spreading languages and narratives. This expansion of 
tribalism has evolved to encompass not only traditional societal 
structures but also vast multinational corporations and 
international organizations such as CERN and the United Nations. 
These entities represent a modern iteration of 'systemified' 
tribalism on a global scale, driven by shared goals, languages, 
and collective narratives.


Quantitative Expansion and 
Quality in Collective Consciousness

**These communal fields of consciousness, although expansive 
in their reach and intensity, typically do not reflect an 
increase in quality. Often, especially in rapidly expanding 
fields, there is a noticeable decline in the quality of 
self-aware consciousness. This is akin to Spotify's algorithms 
for pop music, which tend to gravitate towards the lowest common 
denominator in their inherent drive for growth.

From sporting events to any 
systemic organization of human social interaction, these fields 
are nurtured by competition, existing within a dualistic 
dimension. They require adversaries, engaging in zero-sum games 
to siphon energy from their counterparts. However, cooperation 
is also possible between such spheres, akin to human organs 
working together to keep their human together.

Meditation.dk's idea of a collective, shared 
field of consciousness shares similarities with Yuval Noah 
Harari's concept of intersubjective reality but is not entirely 
the same. While Harari's intersubjective reality is grounded in 
language and storytelling, the collective field of consciousness 
examines phenomena as they occur within consciousness as the 
foundational base.**


From this primordial grounded vantage point, collective fields also emerge from 
various non-cognitive and non-verbal social dynamics.

Constructing a Group's 
Intersubjective Reality of Consciousness****
Creating an intersubjective reality of consciousness within a 
group primarily occurs on two observeable levels:



1) Near-Sense Based collectivity

**On one level, intersubjective connectivity originates from 
pre-linguistic, physical proximity among individuals cohabiting 
in close quarters. This primal tribal interaction leads to 
synchronicity, even on subtle levels, as group members engage in 
daily activities together. They physically inhabit the same 
space, often emulating each other's mannerisms, fashion, and 
more. They even share microbiomes, creating a communal field 
from scent to sight. This intense synchronization fosters a 
strong resonance within a smaller group, not reliant on language 
for cohesion.**


Recent research has revealed that attendees of a classical 
concert can experience synchronized heartbeats, breathing, 
seating, and 
even skin conductivity.
Rockconcerts and technoraves for sure will follow the same 
patterns of synchronization.



2) Storytelling and Intersubjective Realities in Groups

**The power of narrative-driven fields of consciousness 
intensifies as we extend our reach from personal networks into 
the expanse of larger tribal affiliations. These expanded arenas 
are primarily propelled by the sharing of stories articulated in 
a common tongue. Our communal lore not only cements our unity, 
from the camaraderie of sports teams to the collective identity 
of nations but also enhances our prospects for thriving.**


The most compelling of these fields synergize these two facets of 
intersubjective connectivity: the esoteric potency of symbols 
and rites, alongside the orchestrated prelinguistic collective actions, such 
as those seen in military parades, big sport events, and 
rockconcerts.



***The Emergence of Digital Tribes in Contemporary Times **
*In the current digital epoch, the essence of tribal 
consciousness has evolved dramatically. The ascent of social 
media and the proliferation of online communities have catalyzed 
the emergence of modern digital tribes. These cyber collectives 
amalgamate individuals from diverse geographies, linked by 
mutual passions, convictions, fears or endeavors. The digital 
transformation of tribal consciousness is manifest across an 
array of virtual arenas, from discussion forums and social 
networking circles to specialized online networks. These domains 
function as nexuses for dialogue, support, and the nurturing of 
shared identities. Encompassing an array of interests, such 
digital tribes range from eco-activism and anti-vax movements to 
professional affiliations and politically or spiritually unified 
factions, effectively challenging the historical hegemony of 
institutional governance.



The onset of social media has triggered a reemergence of more 
intimate, tribal-like segments within the digital landscape. 
Mobile devices, particularly smartphones, create an illusory 
veneer of tight-knit proximity, echoing the tribal bonds of our 
prehistoric ancestors. Instances abound, from young people 
influenced by online radical propaganda, showcasing how social 
media can disrupt the move towards a more integrated global 
consciousness by fostering virtual microcosms of tribal 
mentality.



Nonetheless, it's essential to acknowledge that, presently, 
these intimate 
online communities paradoxically are devoid of the element of physical 
proximity ad synchronicity afforded by direct sensory engagement—a gap that 
the advent of virtual reality technology may bridge in the near 
future.



The Role of Consciousness in Non-Verbal and Non-Physical 
Synchronization

**It's important to delve into an aspect that remains largely 
unexplored by science and documentation: the ability to 
synchronize within a shared field of consciousness without 
relying on language or the exchange of micro-signals, even at 
the most subtle levels.**


To the best of my understanding,
[Carl 
Gustav Jung](https://pacifica.libguides.com/Jung/synchronicity) is one of the few who has addressed this kind of 
synchronization:

There are 
psychic parallelisms which simply

cannot be related to each other causally.

C.G.Jung

As I intuite it, individuals 
deeply connected through strong fields of consciousness and love 
appear to possess an extraordinary form of intuitive knowledge 
about each other. This includes an innate understanding of each 
other's locations, emotions, and thoughts even when separated by 
great distances.



This phenomenon of precise synchronization becomes particularly 
pronounced during collective meditative practices. In such 
instances, the synchronization can verge on the paranormal. My 
years living in India exposed me to numerous accounts of such 
intuitive connections, shared with and by spiritually advanced 
individuals.



Furthermore, a personal experience I had recently with a friend, 
just a day before composing this text, profoundly exemplified 
this phenomenon. I am quite confident, that the readers who have 
followed me this far, would have many similar stories to 
narrate.



From this paranormal vantage point it is now time to dive into 
the biggest mystery of all in the workings of consciousness.






COSMIC UNITY CONSCIOUSNESS

**

![](/images/cosmic_consciousness.jpg)

**
Cosmic unity consciousnness presents a completely new 
transformative approach. Through the cultivation of 
consciousness in its essential form, it transcends biologically 
inherited tribal divisions. Seen through a historical lens, 
cosmic unity consciousness first happened on the Gangetic Plains 
and then later
[along the silk 
roads](/civilization/civilization-and-consciousness) more than 2.000 years ago.



In Emptiness I am everybody**

** ***"Wisdom tells me I 
am nothing, love tells me I am everything. **
Between the two, my life flows"

*Nisargadatta Maharaj

There are many ways of understanding non-duality.
In this context, by non-duality, I am referring to a state where 
Buddhist '*shunyata*', or emptiness, encompasses everything, 
particularly recognizing all living beings as part of a unified 
whole. Here non-duality takes us from the understanding of that 
there is no 'other', to the understanding that I am everybody 
else.



In this qualitative different mode of consciousness the extended compassion 
of *['metta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitrī)*' 
(loving-kindness) embraces everyone, regardless of caste, creed, 
or culture, in a spirit of universal oneness.

Your deepest roots are in nature.
No matter 
what you are, where you live,
or what kind of life you lead,

you remain irrevocably linked
with the rest of creation.
*Charles Cook

The Self-referential Ouroboros 
Consciousness

**I characterize cosmic unity consciousness as a field that is 
both intense, expansive, and qualitative intelligent. The 
emergence of the non-dual cosmic consciousness begins when 
consciousness starts to reflect back upon itself, a concept 
explored in the chapter on '[Ouroboros 
Consciousness](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness).' This self-reflection in feed-back, even in 
its nascent stages towards a more unified state, profoundly 
impacts both the depth and breadth of the conscious field. I 
would dare to go so far to postulate that a consciousness who 
has not as a minimum entered the ouverture of the Ouroboros 
symphony cannot transcend the brain-harware set limitations of 
tribal duality. It is the destiny of Ourorobos consciousness to 
colonize the universe.**


It is now time to delve deeper into the workings of this 
wonderful phenomenon.



When the soul lies down in that grass,

the world is too full to talk about.

Ideas, language, even the phrase “each other”

doesn’t make any sense.

Rumi




GROUP MEDITATION**





![](/images/merged_auras_meditation.jpg)

**



**Group meditation transcends the mere concept of individuals 
meditating together; it functions as an advanced interface for 
fostering hyper-tribalization enhancing social connections. 
This dynamic approach allows participants, often strangers, to 
swiftly cultivate profound intimacy within a distinct yet 
impersonal setting. Deep engagement in this shared activity 
leads to the shedding of surface-level identities, allowing a 
simultaneous exchange of a unique essence of presence. This 
experience, unique to group meditation, nurtures a sense of 
unity and personal connection that is both deep and singularly 
individual.




**A Shared Field of Consciousess****
Initially, group meditation 
mirrors the process of solo meditation, intensifying our 
empathetic self-connection. When we close our eyes during 
meditation, our body awareness is immediately amplified, 
grounding us in a realm of
[
"I am Me"](/fields/fields-of-consciousness#SPIRALING_RINGS_OF_ME_&_MINE_) consciousness, centered around our physical being. 
This heightened awareness then extends beyond ourselves, 
allowing us to become more aware of our surroundings, even with 
our eyes closed. In this introspective state, we become attuned 
to the presence of others nearby. This progression into "You are 
part of Me" consciousness deepens our connection with those 
around us, fostering a profound, intimate bond that transcends 
language, where words, while helpful, are not necessary for this 
shared experience fo precense.



Group meditation swiftly and powerfully activates bonding 
processes typically associated with family and friends, 
frequently exceeding the depth of traditional familial 
connections. This powerful dynamic has the potential to 
transform ingrained behavioral patterns. During group meditation 
sessions, intense bonds are formed quickly, achieving in a brief 
period what would normally require years. Remarkably, these 
connections often arise even between strangers, shedding light 
on why individuals participating in more secterian meditation groups might favor these newfound 
relationships over long-standing family bonds.



As a general rule, group meditation unfolds 
[as a linear expansion of the 
collective](/fields/fields-of-consciousness#Quantitative_Expansion_and_Quality_in_Collective_Consciousness_) consciousness. A notable indicator of this linear 
extension in the consciousness circle is the emergence of an 'us 
versus them' mentality, which manifests as a 'we are holier than 
you' attitude. As explored in the previous chapter, "Fields of 
Consciousness," our tribal legacy of forming bonds typically 
evolves from smaller units to increasingly larger collectives, 
such as nations. This progression often creates a metaphorical 
protective barrier, delineating a sense of order (*cosmos*) 
in contrast to disorder (*chaos*), reflecting our innate 
tribal instinct to define and protect our group identity.



Let us now look at the mysterious 
glue that connects us in such a state of collective 
consciousness.

THE UNCOVERING OF THE HEART & THE AVATAR INTERFACE**





![](/images/skins.jpeg)




* 
"A human being has so many skins
inside, covering the depths of the heart.
**
We know so many things, but we don't know ourselves!

Why, thirty or forty skins or hides, as thick and hard as an ox's or
bear's,

cover the soul. Go into your own ground and learn to know yourself
there."

*Meister Eckhart

Meister Eckhart's profound insight 
reveals that within each human being lie multiple layers, akin 
to skins or hides, that shroud the true depths of the heart. He 
emphasizes our extensive knowledge of the world, yet a startling 
lack of self-understanding. These layers, as numerous and tough 
as the hides of oxen or bears, serve as barriers to our soul, 
urging us to delve into our inner selves for true 
self-awareness.



This metaphor extends to the concept of group consciousness and 
the necessity of open vulnerability for its realization. Our 
emotional wounds, manifested as weaknesses, insecurities, shame, 
and guilt, often remain concealed as we, as social beings, are 
conditioned to mask our vulnerabilities. This protective 
mechanism is the role of the ego, designed to shield us from 
both external judgment and internal scrutiny, ensuring our 
survival in a social hierarchy where showing weakness can be 
perceived as a liability.



These 'thick skins' that The Meister refers to are the facades we 
present to the world, preventing us from achieving a deeper 
connection with the fragmented parts of our being, and, by 
extension, inhibiting the potential for true symbiosis within a 
group. Only by shedding these layers and embracing vulnerability 
can we hope to achieve a more profound, collective consciousness 
and self-realization.



Authenticity is rooted in vulnerability.

**When the setting of a meditative space feels safe, 
individuals begin to trust and acknowledge their vulnerabilities 
to themselves. This is the first step towards authenticity, 
moving away from the need to impress or adopt false personas. In 
such a space, people engage in collective, impersonal 
vulnerability, which is the 
[essence of authenticity](/love/the-super-awake-flow#What_is_the_Self_-_Is_it_Authentic_).**


The Avatar plug

**The concept of the Avatar plug in the movie 'Avatar' 
metaphorically illustrates this principle. The hero's connection 
with his dragon through a physical cable symbolizes the union of 
human and ancient kundalini power, achievable only through 
nobility, honesty, and vulnerability. This connection represents 
a 'stargate' or a pivotal point, opening the pathway to profound 
self-awareness and power.

![](/images/avatar.jpg)

In an ideal group meditation, 
participants relinquish their defensive mechanisms, embracing 
openness and vulnerability. This state allows for a genuine 
connection with one's true power. Openness to vulnerability 
heightens sensitivity, facilitating a deeper introspective 
journey.**


In this sensitivity, 
we all plug into each other in a collective state of oneness. 
However, it is crucial here to distinguish between narcissistic 
vulnerability and the type of sensitive openness in a meditative 
field. The meditative openness is impersonal and not disturbed 
by storytelling made by the mind. In impersonal 
openness, we 'aware' all 

['aware' all inner sensations](Meditativ_pixellering.htm) 
without naming them.



However, this field is only as powerful as its weakest link. Just one person's 
unconscious unwillingness to be vulnerable affects the intensity of 
the whole field. If everybody in a meditative circle could let 
the wound be open, the intensity of the field would grow 
exponentially with the number of participants. However, a larger 
number of individuals in the circle as a general rule make people feel less safe, 
and hence the field gets weaker. 

![](/images/group_meditation_avatar.jpeg)


THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STORIES WE TELL OURSELVES AND OTHERS

**The stories we weave for ourselves and share with others 
hold significant power, shaping our perspectives and emotional 
states. Achieving a state of openness hinges largely on the 
narrative we construct internally. The right story can foster a 
sense of open vulnerability, leading to growth and 
understanding, while an unhelpful narrative can trap us in a 
cycle of despair.**


A compelling example is the journey of Olympic meditation master
[
Mingyur Rinpoche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGQ2mxjkb2E&t=217s), who suffered from intense anxiety and 
panic attacks in his youth. He transformed his experience by 
altering the narrative he lived by. Instead of viewing his 
anxiety as a debilitating force, he reframed it as a beneficial 
ally, a potent source of energy for his meditation practice. 
This shift in perspective profoundly changed his relationship 
with his anxiety and more importantly, it improved his 
meditation practize.



Viewing oneself as a victim is the problem child of our time. It can be likened to a spiritual 
malaise, limiting personal growth and inner peace. Conversely, 
reshaping one's narrative to see oneself as an overcomer, facing 
and surmounting challenges on the path to triumph, can 
drastically alter one's life trajectory. This approach empowers 
individuals, turning obstacles into stepping stones towards 
personal fulfillment and achievement.




However, in the context of group 
meditation, it's crucial to establish a connection with the 
unspoken aspects of our internal wounds. These wounds can 
effectively serve as an 'avatar plug' only when acknowledged as 
forms of 'energy' within our conscious and aware selves. While a 
well-crafted story can create the environment for a shared 
consciousness field, it should not intrude into the core of this 
experience. It should never enter the octagon itself. In this 
communion with oneself, words have no place; the interaction is 
beyond verbal expression, emphasizing a wordless connection 
between your inner self and the collective consciousness.




AUTHORITARIAN FIELDS AND THE ROLE OF THE GURU**

I am a finger 
pointing to the moon. **
Don't look at me; look at the moon.

Buddha

Throughout my 
extensive observation of various meditation practices, I've 
realized that these spaces are often deeply rooted in ancient 
storytelling, particularly in the way they establish their 
meditative framework. This leads to a natural inclination 
towards a leadership-centric model. Despite our idealized 
notions of egalitarian hunter-gatherer societies, democracy, in 
my view, is a relatively recent and more fragile social 
structure in the span of human history. Historically, we have 
predominantly lived under leadership systems, and this tendency 
becomes even more pronounced in times of crisis or upheaval, a 
common catalyst for individuals embarking on spiritual journeys. 
Consequently, it's common for new age meditation groups to 
revolve around a central leader. However, in our modern era, 
these hierarchical systems are increasingly misaligned with 
contemporary societal needs. In fact, the overly top-down social 
systems often observed demonstrates a regression, a fall back 
into archaic systemic interfaces used in previous historical 
periods.

In meditation, particularly within 
a group setting, the biggest hurdle is often the ego's 
well-intentioned but obstructive efforts to protect us. In 
hierarchical structures with an authoritative leader, 
participants might relinquish their egos to this leader, 
resolving the issue of self-protection, albeit at a significant 
cost. Such authoritarian environments can amplify the group's 
collective energy but may also suppress meta-consciousness and 
independent thinking. This is evident from historical and 
contemporary examples where sects under strong authoritarian 
influence have led to destructive outcomes.



Acknowledging the inherent risk of power corrupting leaders, 
from gurus to politicians, a horizontal structure in meditative 
groups is favored. In such a setting, mentors and teachers 
understand that their knowledge doesn't equate to control over 
the group. Instead, they lead by example, fostering individual 
freedom and inspiring participants to tailor spiritual teachings 
to their personal journeys. This model nurtures a community of 
shared learning and growth, where positive storytelling thrives, 
unimpeded by the pitfalls of authoritarian leadership.



This perspective does not negate the value of spiritually 
advanced leaders and teachers who lead by example rather than 
command. The principle is straightforward: while I may possess 
extensive knowledge about the moon, and thus can inspire others 
by sharing this knowledge, it doesn't imply ownership of the 
moon. My role is to enlighten and motivate through my own 
experiences and understanding, recognizing that wisdom is a 
shared resource, not a possession.

"A man chooses 
the religion and path of his friend."

Sufi quote

In this regard, the Sufi tradition 
is especially commendable. They often employ the term 'companion' to 
describe the relationship between the wise ones and their 
followers. This choice of wording highlights a sense of 
camaraderie and mutual journeying on the spiritual path, rather 
than a hierarchical teacher-student dynamic. It underscores a 
shared experience of discovery and enlightenment, emphasizing 
the value of collective wisdom and mutual respect in the 
spiritual journey.



One of the most extraordinary spiritual inspirators I met was
[Papaji from Lucknow](papaji_and_meditation.htm). His 
sense of humour was second to none, but there was always stern 
advices embedded in his words. He said:

"If a teacher tells you to do 
this or that

he should not be called a teacher.

He should be called a butcher!

Don't listen to anyone!
Don't even listen to me!
Listen to your own Soul

A true Masters message can only be: 

There is no teaching
There is no teacher
There is no student"

*This guy will not tell you what to do. I guarante that.

Because I created him - with the kind help of Dall-e.

Fundamentally we always create our own gurus.*





EVERSIVE GROUP MEDITATION

**Let's now contemplate the potential of a qualitatively distinct 
field. Imagine if a group were to gather, each person 
potentially embodying 
what I previously have described as
[
cosmic eversive](/fields/fields-of-consciousness#Cosmic_Consciousness_) [ouroboric 
consciousness](/ouroboros/ouroboros-consciousness). As for my personal experience, have I encountered this eversive 
ouroboric unity consciousness? Perhaps only in fleeting moments, 
but these glimpses are enough to convince me of its tangible 
possibility. However, it's important to acknowledge that the 
meditation group I currently facilitate is more linear in its 
capability, and has not yet embraced the eversive aspect I now 
am going to elaborate upon.**


Eversive Circles of *Holy Ghost*

**In the utopian realm of group meditation, I've occasionally 
glimpsed a profound phenomenon. Unable to empirically prove, yet 
compelled to share this story-telling, I recount experiences of 
transcending my own physicality when deeply secure among others 
in a similar state of surrender. In such moments, I occasionally 
experience a sudden shift, finding myself within another 
participant's body in the circle. In this state, I can sense and 
perceive the emotions and visions of both individuals and the 
group collectively. Concurrently, there's an awareness that 
others in this shared field also possess access to this communal 
knowledge, creating a profound sense of interconnectedness and 
shared understanding. **


This collective experience, reminiscent of the Christian notion 
of the Holy Ghost, resonates with Jesus' words about his 
presence among those united in his name. Here, the communal 
consciousness manifests as the Holy Ghost itself. In this state, 
I become part of this collective spirit, expanding into the 
totality of existence. This transcendent experience defies 
linear group consciousness, evolving instead into an eversive, 
oroboric implosion encompassing all.



Cosmic Unity Consciousness is the denial of denials

**In eversive ouroboros meditation, 'tribality' is nullified. I'll make 
sure to repeat the Meister to clarify things. Meditation is, in 
its ideal essence, the denial of denials.



*All
creatures contain one reflection: **
one, that is the denial of its being
the other;

the highest of the angels denies he is the lowest.


God is the denial of denials.

*Meister Eckhart

In the Buddhist compassion 
traditions, the monks are not praying for the well-being of 
their football team. They pray for all living beings. Such is 
the essential nature of cosmic consciousness: It expands in 
eversiveness until it has conquered all duality. The final conclusion 
is reached with this statement:

*Tat twam asi -
[
You are that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahāvākyas#Tat_Tvam_Asi)*

Therefore Meister Eckhart says 
that you* 
*must be free from* 
naught. (not)*

*To be undivided you must be free from not.*

In this state, the 'I am you' 
realizes that it is everything, not even sentient beings but all 
collapsed waveforms. This is why I kiss my fridge door when I 
come home after a long journey. Then I say hello to the walls 
and my sofa, and they all seem to respond in a glow. This 
happens when the omnipresent eversive pan-consciousness merges with the 
stronger light coming from the torch of the human brain.


The mysterious glue of 
love

** All strife, every disagreement, every cancellation is based on a deep down 
notion. It says:


*I am not you.*


In states of expanded Consciousnss, the first 
fundamental realization is:


I am You.


**In expanded states of 
consciousness we become empaths

**Cosmic**
**consciousness serves as a unifying force, enabling us to not 
only see but also become the viewpoint of 'the other.' In 
Christianity, followers are taught to love their neighbors as 
themselves. However, when filtered through the thinking mind, 
this becomes a commandment to be obeyed like a traffic rule. It 
turns into an action we believe must be done, and when we 
forget, we feel guilty and revert to our collectively created 
morality to correct our behavior. As consciousness expands in 
quality and quantity, the astonishing revelation emerges that 
our neighbor is, in fact, ourselves. Loving sentient beings then 
becomes a natural and spontaneous consequence of cosmic consciousness.**


The group meditation field is using the drivers from our ancient 
tribal interfaces. However, when it grows not only in expansive 
intensity but also in eversive meta-aware quality, it holds the 
possibility to transcend the limitations of its own archaic 
programming that for thousand of years have set us in duality in 
opposition to others.



In this blessed space we pray for all sentient beings. We merge 
with everyone and everything while bridging the gap between 
duality and non-duality with the help cosmic glue of love.



In the Pantheon of beautiful meditative phenomenons this is the 
most beautiful.
