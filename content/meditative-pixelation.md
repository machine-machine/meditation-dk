MEDITATIVE PIXELLATION**** 
*

Exploring Inner Sensations through Conscious Awareness***




'Out beyond 
ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,**
there is a field. I’ll meet you there.

When the soul lies down in that grass,

the world is too full to talk about.

Ideas, language, even the phrase 'each other'

doesn’t make any sense.

Rumi




*
Eyes Wide Shut

***The most fundamental meditation technique is also the 
simplest: closing your eyes while remaining fully awake. Within 
this effortless act lies a profoundly important realization—one 
that does not require striving, only surrender to presence.**


The instant you close your eyes, a subtle yet transformative 
shift occurs: the body’s myriad sensations rise into conscious 
awareness, revealing a vast inner landscape that is always 
present but rarely noticed. This shift happens suddenly, almost 
startlingly, illuminating a sensory world that has long existed 
in the background, quietly sustaining us, waiting to be seen, to 
be recognized by consciousness.



Try it now. Close your eyes for a moment. Feel the gentle pulsing of your 
heartbeat. Notice the faint warmth spreading through your hands. 
Sense the subtle tension resting in your shoulders. These 
sensations have always been there, yet they often fade into the 
background of daily life. What unfolds in that silent space 
behind closed eyes is not emptiness, but presence.



To explore this more deeply, engage in a simple yet revealing 
exercise: close and open your eyes in 30-second intervals, 
shifting awareness inward and outward repeatedly. Observe what 
changes. Notice how perception subtly alters with each 
transition—how the external world immediately asserts itself 
when your eyes are open, while the moment they close, a 
different, often neglected reality begins to emerge.



Through this rhythmic alternation, we can start to discern the 
boundary—one that is not rigid but fluid—between outer-directed 
consciousness and the vast, silent field of awareness beneath 
it.




The Hidden Landscape of Awareness

**
[Consciousness is 
typically blind to the awareness that underlies it](/consciousness/defining-awareness-consciousness). We do 
not register what we are subtly aware of—unless something 
disrupts the pattern. Ordinarily, we perceive only a fraction of 
the body’s dynamic sensory flow, while beneath consciousness, a 
vast current of sensations hums—subtle yet powerful, like an 
unseen river beneath perception.**



In this unconscious realm, a chorus of voices emerges—not in 
harmony, but in discord, each carrying its own rhythm and tone. 
Closing your eyes grants conscious access to this hidden 
vibrancy, making the once-unnoticed sensory world suddenly 
tangible.




A refrigerator hums in the 
background—unnoticed until it stops. In that moment of silence, 
you suddenly consciously realize you were aware of it all along. 
Similarly, body parts that function perfectly often escape our 
conscious attention—until something goes wrong. If you injure 
your foot, it immediately demands full awareness. The same 
applies to our conflicting inner personalities. They dwell in 
the realm of primordial awareness, operating beneath the surface 
of consciousness. Yet, the moment they exert pressure—like a 
tightening grip—we become acutely aware of their constant 
presence within us.



This reveals a fundamental 
paradox: we are constantly aware of our body, yet largely 
unconscious of that awareness. While consciousness is only drawn 
to novelty and disruption, awareness has two modes: Like 
consciousness, awareness is instinctually attuned to detecting 
sudden changes. However, it also harbors a deep undercurrent 
that operates in a state of continuous immediacy, effortlessly 
perceiving and holding what remains constant. Here it operates 
in a continuous, effortless flow, holding and perceiving the 
steady rhythms of cellular existence.




The Limits of Language: 
Consciousness Beyond Expansion****
I am not a quantum physicist, but I dare to postulate that the 
ouroboic space—unlike the external Newtonian space—is closer 
to a 
quantum space. Consciousness itself is the primordial ground 
where quantum fields of superposition unfold. With this 
intuition fresh in mind, we can return to Tony Woody’s account 
of [the exploding Pepsi can](#from_somewhere_this_pepsi_can), where thousands of Pepsi droplets 
did not merely appear before him—they became him.




This is why vocabulary borrowed from the quantum world feels, at 
least intuitively, more fitting. Terms like superposition, 
entanglement, and non-locality gesture toward realities that 
transcend classical logic, hinting at the elusive, paradoxical 
nature of consciousness. Yet even these concepts—groundbreaking 
as they are—fall short. They are, after all, still rooted in the 
descriptive models of the very universe that consciousness 
upholds.




The crux of this limitation lies in a simple yet profound truth: 
[consciousness is primordial](/consciousness/consciousness-beyond-qualia). It is not a phenomenon within the 
universe, but the very ground from which the universe arises. 
Consciousness is eo ipso—self-evident, self-originating, and 
foundational. It precedes the quantum field, the fabric of 
space-time, and any conceptual framework we attempt to impose 
upon it.




Because consciousness is the condition for all perception and 
understanding, it cannot be fully contained within the 
structures it upholds. Trying to describe consciousness from 
within the universe it makes possible is akin to asking a mirror 
to reflect itself without an object before it. The reflection 
requires a medium, yet consciousness is both the medium and the 
reflection—simultaneously the canvas and the painting, the 
silence and the song.



However, as mentioned often on this site, this limitation does not mean we should abandon the 
attempt. On the contrary, the very act of trying brings us 
closer to what 
[Emanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant) referred to as the *Ding an sich*—the
*'thing-in-itself.'* Though we are inevitably confined to 
experiencing reality through the lens of the *'Ding für uns'*—the
*'thing-for-us,'* filtered through perception and 
cognition—there remains an innate drive to reach beyond these 
boundaries. This striving is not futile; it is the evolutionary 
pulse of consciousness itself, folding back to recognize its own 
essence.



Each metaphor, each fragment of language, is like the enigmatic
[
footprints of the Buddha](/consciousness/between-nothing-and-something#The_Enigmatic_Buddhas_Footprints_). Even when words fall short, they point, they hint, 
they gesture toward the ineffable. Perhaps that is their highest 
function—not to capture reality, but to remind us of its 
vastness.



In this spirit, we continue to define consciousness in an 
impossible dance with it. To articulate the inarticulable. To 
stand, however briefly, in awe of the fact that we can even ask 
the question.





MEDITATIVE *'PIXELLATION'*

**Consciously resting in innocent body-awareness—always 
catching sensations, feelings, and emotions before they capture 
us—can ultimately lead to a process I term *'meditative 
pixellation'*. It is *
the *the process of breaking down awareness into finer and 
finer sensory details though the power of by will directed 
consciousness.**


Meditative pixellation is the process of deconstructing all 
inner experiences—emotions, sensations, and thoughts—into raw, 
neutral micro-perceptions, beyond conceptual interpretation. 
By zooming in on the microtextures of our inner 
world, we move beyond identity and enter the realm of direct, 
felt experience. This allows us to consciously aware reality as it is, unfiltered 
by the mind’s habitual narratives.



Imagine a digital image. As you zoom in closer and closer, the 
picture gradually dissolves into pixels, losing its original 
meaning. Similarly, as you become more attuned to consciously 
perceiving the myriad sensations within your body, you gain the 
ability to move beyond the conceptual barriers imposed by naming 
and labeling. In this abstract, primal reality, distinctions and 
boundaries dissolve. We become part of a fluid continuum—a 
boundless, pixelated existence. Just as a high-resolution image 
dissolves into pixels when magnified, our inner world loses its 
conditioned interpretations when examined closely. Sensations 
once labeled as ‘anger,’ ‘joy,’ or ‘fear’ become abstract, 
vibrating micro-perceptions, —just pure 
presence.




Pixels Are Neither Bad Nor Good**




* "There is nothing either 
good or bad, but thinking makes it so." **
*Shakespeare Hamlet, Act 2, Scene 2.



Just as every digital image—whether a portrait of Jesus or 
the devil—is fundamentally composed of the same neutral pixels, 
so too are our sensations, feelings, and emotions. Magnified 
beyond their conditioned interpretations, all experiences 
dissolve into raw, vibrating sensory phenomena. When you zoom 
into an image, you no longer see beauty or ugliness, meaning or 
narrative—you see neutral dots. The same is true of our 
emotions: zoom in, and they dissolve into pure, pulsing sensory 
energy, stripped of judgment.



Rumi’s *‘field beyond right and wrong’* invites us to a realm 
where distinctions dissolve—where perception, stripped of 
judgment, becomes raw, direct, and unfiltered. This is precisely 
what happens when we zoom into the microstructure of experience 
itself: the world dissolves into pure sensation, much like an 
image disintegrating into pixels when magnified.



As Rumi suggests, in that field beyond ideas and language, even 
the notion of ‘each other’ ceases to make sense. The sharp edges 
of identity, duality, and separation blur into the vast openness 
of raw perception.



*Tathata* - Suchness

**This state of ‘pixelation’ aligns with what Buddhist 
traditions call *‘tathata’—suchness*, the direct experience 
of things as they are, unmediated by thought or concept. By 
sensing our inner body free from concepts—so intimately that all 
we perceive is the continuous flow of micro-sensations—we begin 
to 'innerstand' that sensations and feelings are neither 
inherently good nor bad.**


Beyond the wall of naming and judgment, pain and pleasure lose 
their conventional distinctions. The need for evaluation 
dissolves, leaving no space or function for thoughts to navigate 
this terrain.



Through this process, the first layer of mental interpretation 
dissolves. The body’s inner sensory space ceases to be a stage 
for emotional drama and instead reveals itself as a field of 
super-aware microdots of 'something'—pure suchness, free from 
conventional narrative entanglement.



When feelings and emotions are perceived on the level of pixels, 
they lose their capacity to be hijacked by elaborate thought 
dramas. In this sense, the pixel-state is innocent, untouched by 
the habitual loops of mental storytelling. Here, sensations 
remain raw and direct, free from the cognitive hooks that 
otherwise entangle them in the world of thought.




Let me offer a brief example. A group of us once sat watching a 
sunset in the Himalayas. Some remained in silent awe, absorbed 
in the golden light. Others let out soft murmurs—an *"ohh" *
or an *"ahh"*—while a few whispered, *"It’s beautiful,"* 
or, *"It looks like gold."* Then, one man broke the 
moment’s spell: *"This reminds me of a sunset back in Denmark 
when we got drunk and argued about politics. Speaking of 
politics, what’s your take on the prime minister?"

*

The moment had vanished. The sunset was no longer a direct 
experience—it had become a backdrop for personal narratives, a 
springboard for unrelated thoughts. This is how the mind pulls 
us away from presence, weaving stories instead of allowing us to 
simply be.



This example illustrates how easily the mind can be pulled out 
of a raw, sensed experience into the world of narratives and 
thought spirals. The man’s comment transformed a moment of 
direct sensory awe into a mental rabbit hole of unrelated and 
disembodied 
stories and opinions, distancing him and others from the present 
reality of the sunset. 





*'Ahh'*-Sensing the Warmth of Light****
The pixel-state invites us to remain present, anchored in the 
raw sensations themselves, without allowing thoughts to spiral 
into distracting narratives.
This is the simple path to inner freedom: be consciously aware 
of yourself—know and *'aha-aware'* thyself—not as a detached observer 
but as a non-judgmental senser in awe. This is, in fact, the *
'ohh'* or *'ahh'*-state. It is not about seeing the 
light, which implies separation and dual distance, but about 
experiencing its warmth in subject-object union. To truly sense 
the light is to feel its presence intimately, dissolving the 
barriers that divide perception and sensed being. 







Within this inner world, dualities fade. There is no "observer" 
in the conventional sense, but rather an *"ahh-senser,"* intimately 
embedded in the experience itself—fully immersed in pure 
conscious awareness.



The pixel-state invites us to stay 
present, intimate anchored in raw sensation, without thoughts pulling us 
into narratives. This is the simple path to inner freedom: to 
know and ‘aha-aware’ oneself—not as a distant observer, but as a 
direct experiencer of life. It is not about seeing the light 
from afar, but about feeling its warmth dissolve into you, until 
there is no ‘you’ left to separate from it.



Pixels as 
'Energy'****
When we step into what I call the *Rumian grass field*, the 
conditioned labels of pleasant and unpleasant dissolve. Yet 
something remains—something alive, dynamic, and flowing. At this 
level, words still hold some value, though they are stripped of 
conventional meaning. For simplicity, I will metaphorically call 
this *'energy'.

*


What we once labeled pain—before bringing it into the light of 
conscious awareness—now reveals itself as a fluid, morphing, 
pixelated stream of sensation. Just as particles in quantum 
physics are ultimately forms of frozen energy or light, the 
building blocks of our inner experience appear as liquid 
wave-like movements of energy. However, these are merely poetic 
metaphors, inspired by a quantum world that I can only speculate 
about. The real invitation is not to theorize but to aha-sense the ever-changing nature of our inner reality without 
the need for preconditioned definitions.



While terms like 'pixels' and 'energy' are still fundamentally 
thoughts, they lack the structure required to evolve into 
narrative storytelling and, more importantly, do not spiral into 
the drama-filled rabbit holes of mental reality. Instead, they 
stay closer to the simple, raw, and unembellished impressions 
they represent.



Beyond the, in this sense, barren terms of 'pixels' and 
'energy,' there lies an intriguing observation: the deeper one 
ventures into this abstract realm of inner energies, the more 
energized and rejuvenated one feels afterward. This might 
explain why Eastern traditions coined the term 'prana,' equating 
it with life-energy—the subtle, vital force flowing through and 
sustaining us.



However, I deliberately choose not to use that term here, as it 
has been heavily monopolized by Eastern thought and comes with a 
set of cultural associations that could distract from the path I 
wish to point out. My aim is to stay rooted in a direct, 
experiential understanding, free from preconceived notions tied 
to established traditions.



The Challenge

**For anyone willing to explore the inner world of sensations 
and feelings through courageous introspection, here is the 
challenge:**


Any sensation, feeling, or emotion—no matter how pleasant or 
unpleasant it seems—will ultimately dissolve into pure, neutral 
'energy' for the one who continues to observe it with 
vigilant innocent conscious awareness.



State of Simple & Sensed Amor Fati



In this pixelating state of 
observation, focus solely on the phenomenon of awaring in itself, 
without attempting to change or eliminate sensations through 
mental strategies. Resist the temptation to weave stories around 
them. The key lies in mentally ignoring the age-old instinctual 
urge to 'do' something—especially in response to unpleasant 
sensations—while offering them your full, non-cognitive 
conscious attention.



Ignore Yourself in full Conscious Awareness

**This form of non-doing meditation emphasizes the direct 
encounter between your innocent 'aha' awareness and the 
interoceptive sensations themselves. You become passive yet 
present, ignoring yourself while simultaneously giving yourself 
full, undivided conscious attention. This state can be called a 
state of simple sensed *amor fati*—a loving acceptance of 
what is, exactly as it is.**




THE SECRET LIFE OF OUR BODY

**We are now ready to embark on a journey into the secret life 
of our own body. With the torchlight of consciousness, we will 
explore the largely unknown landscapes of our inner biological 
beingness. With each passing minute, day, month, and year, we 
deepen our mastery of this practice. It is truly an art in which 
we are both the artist and the masterpiece.**


Socrates' famous words, *"To know thyself is the beginning of 
wisdom,"* take on a new meaning in this context—one that 
invites us to become intimately familiar with the subtle energy 
formations within our body.



At the core of this exploration lies the axis mundi of pixelated 
energy, running from the base of the spine to the top of the 
head. Along this torso-axis are key hotspots where energies can surge, 
sometimes becoming difficult to contain in neutral conscious 
awareness due to their intensity. These energies may 
traditionally labeled as negative, manifest as discomfort, 
offensiveness, anger, or anxiety.




You may wonder, Why engage with these energies? Why not simply 
suppress or control them? The answer is simple: the more 
unpleasantness you can hold and digest within your conscious 
field of awareness, the greater your capacity for emotional 
healing and bodily intelligence becomes.




We feel to heal, but only when we do not story tell this field.




Through this process, we come to 'innerstand' ourselves more deeply, 
developing the courage of a warrior to hunt and consume what we 
once labeled as 'negative' life-energies within our body’s inner 
animal kingdom. Instead of rejecting or repressing these 
energies, we absorb and integrate them, transforming what once 
felt overwhelming into a source of strength and wisdom.



This is the path of embodied self-discovery.




Biochemical Sensing 
Instead of Known Feelings

**Take any feeling, especially one that is fresh and 
prominent under this pixellating magnifying glass. If time and space allow, lie down and examine it 
closely. It could be a cluster of fear tightening the stomach or 
a tension constricting the throat. When contemplating someone 
you love, you might feel warmth radiating from the chest or a 
pleasant lightness spreading throughout the body. Notice the 
sensation of lightness when feeling happy—how it subtly 
manifests in different areas of your body.**


Now, as you step into the anatomical landscape of these 
so-called familiar emotions, you may uncover a profoundly simple 
truth: behind the culturally and linguistically defined labels 
of anger, joy, jealousy, love, offense, or well-being lie 
abstract biochemical sensations rooted in various locations of 
the inner body. What I refer to as energy is nothing more than 
biochemical sensory phenomena displayed on the interoceptive 
stage of awareness. And, as I’ve repeated like a mantra, all we 
do in meditation is add the light of pure consciousness to this 
inner experience.




In reality, what 
we think of as familiar emotions are, when broken down into 
their core components, spatially expanded electrochemical energy 
phenomena.



Let us revisit the previously mentioned images of Jesus and the 
Devil as a metaphor. Before we begin to magnify these images 
into pure pixelation, there exists an intermediary field where 
we can still perceive forms, shapes, and clusters of colors. 
Similarly, in the inner world of emotions, there is a state of 
observation where our named feelings—such as anger, pride, or 
joy—shed their traditional identification markers and stand 
before us as clusters of sensations with distinct qualities, 
textures, and shapes.



At this level of perception, it also becomes easier to spatially 
locate where these energy phenomena are experienced within the 
body. Love may manifest as warmth in the chest, anxiety as 
tightness in the gut, or offense as a burning sensation in the 
throat.



The key to transforming our emotional landscape lies in moving 
beyond conceptual labels and directly feeling these raw, 
pixelated clusters of sensations. By doing so, you shift from 
reacting to your emotions as fixed stories to experiencing them 
as dynamic, ever-changing energy flows within your body’s 
sensory landscape.



In this pixelated state, emotions and feelings lose their 
habitual instinctual pathways.
Imagine a person or situation that has made you unhappy. When 
you attentively and meditatively look inward, you'll discover 
that what your mind interprets as 'unhappiness' is actually a 
sensory phenomenon within your own body. You may feel a knot in 
your solar plexus, accompanied by butterflies or a sensation 
akin to jellyfish in your stomach. If you are not present at 
this moment, you'll start engaging in a dialogue between your 
burning jellyfish-self and your thinking self. These two will 
create a feedback loop that, if you're not careful, becomes your 
unending re-enforcing narrative. This narrative becomes your 
reality—a reality where you live and jump around like a frog at the bottom of a well 
rather than getting the over-view as a free bird in the sky.



Consider this simple experiment: The next time you feel 
irritated or angry at someone, resist the impulse to focus your 
mental energy on crafting a cutting reply. Instead, turn inward 
and investigate what is happening inside your body. Notice the 
electrical tension or tightness in your gut or throat. If you 
bring conscious awareness to these sensations, it is almost 
certain that your reaction will change.



However, this is not an easy task. The more prone we are to 
anger, the less consciously aware we tend to be in those 
moments.



To move beyond the conceptual wall and fully reside in the world 
of sensed clusters requires patience and practice. It is a 
journey of a lifetime—a gradual peeling away of layers until you 
no longer live in the world of stories but in the reality of 
direct, embodied experience.




Every Energy Bundle Represents a Distinct Bio-Operative System

**The next step in life is to consciously explore the energy 
formations within various parts of your body. For example, allow 
your inner conscious light to merge with the awareness in your 
hands as they rest on your stomach. Notice how the awareness in 
your hands and stomach begin to blend into a unified sensation. 
You might feel something akin to the famous “butterflies” in 
your stomach—tickling, crawling, burning, nervous, or electric 
energy. These sensations often resemble pain. Let them flow 
freely and integrate with the more neutral energy ball in your 
hands, allowing both areas to harmonize.**


As discussed in the chapter 
[Consciousness & Evolution](/consciousness/consciousness-and-evolution), the human 
body is a living archive of remodified and recycled genetic 
information stretching back to the beginning of life.



A friend once told me that during both of his LSD experiences, 
he felt as though there was a hostile, meat-eating plant 
residing in his stomach. To me, this indicates that his stomach 
was not happy and had been unable to communicate its 
discomfort—until the psychedelically tuned brain gave it a voice 
in the form of dream-like symbols.



Each body part, each organ, and even clusters of organs possess 
their own unique energy signature. These distinct energy bundles 
form the wordless language through which our ancient biological 
systems attempt to communicate with us. The vast majority of 
these systems do not understand verbal language or cognition. 
Therefore, we must meet them on their own terms, engaging with 
them through direct sensory awareness.



The Shapes and Movements of Inner Sensory Patterns

**These internal, abstract sensory shapes consist of bundles 
of electrochemical energy that continuously fluctuate in myriad 
forms and variations. They are unique to each individual and 
each moment, evolving in response to both the external 
environment and our thought processes. These sensory patterns 
can feel constricted or expanded and typically have distinct 
locations, shapes, and dimensions.**


A sensory pattern may extend its tendrils into the arms, legs, 
or head, but its core generally resides within the torso. Think 
of the torso as the “Rome” of our inner body—a central hub from 
which countless “sensory pattern civilizations” extend their 
pathways, stretching from the sphincter muscle up to the top of 
the head and outward into the limbs. These abstract energy 
patterns often manifest as independent entities with a central 
core and tentacle-like projections that traverse the body's 
inner ocean.



As we become more familiar with these ancient operative systems, 
we discover that different “zoological” sensory patterns belong 
to different regions of the body. For example, some might 
resemble writhing serpents, others like pulsating jellyfish, 
each with its own rhythm, intensity, and form.



Naming the Inner Phenomena

**One might argue that assigning names to internal experiences 
risks falling into the trap of thought-based storytelling. 
Indeed, if we begin creating narratives, dramas, or 
identities—especially victim identities—we risk losing the 
purity of direct experience. However, fresh metaphorical naming, 
when used as a tool rather than a crutch, can serve as a bridge 
for consciousness to explore new inner territories.**


This is because while the ancient bio-operative systems within 
us do not understand logic, some of the more recently evolved 
systems are attuned to symbolic thinking—as seen in the 
LSD-induced vision of a meat-eating plant. Before words became 
tools of rationality, they existed as sounds and symbols, acting 
as a bridge between sensory experience and meaning.



Of course these homegrown symbols can act as a new mental trap 
for ego-identification. I must admit it did so for me on my 
journey inwards. However, used wisely they can act as symbolic anchors, guiding us 
deeper into uncharted realms of our internal landscape without 
dragging us into narrative distractions. The key is to use these 
metaphors lightly, allowing them to serve as helpful signposts 
rather than definitive labels. When used wisely, they enhance 
our capacity to engage with the hidden sensory life within us, 
bringing conscious awareness to the ancient and ever-evolving 
[bio-operative systems that sustain our being.](/consciousness/consciousness-and-evolution)








THE INNER MORPHING****
If an anthropologist visits a Stone Age tribe that has never had 
contact with modern civilization, the tribe will change 
irreversibly the moment that contact is made. It will never be 
the same tribe again, and there is little possibility of 
returning to its original state. The same is true when you 
consciously visit your own body.



Conscious awareness profoundly affects the inner zoo of energy 
systems residing within us. As we bring conscious awareness to 
these inner creatures, they begin to morph and transform. This 
process is a journey of self-discovery, where the rigid 
constructs of our inner world melt into fluid, dynamic patterns.



As we descend into deeper levels of life, these energy systems 
begin to shift their configurations. They no longer remain static 
but begin to evolve, almost like plants responding to sunlight.



Through personal 
observation, you may notice how these sensory patterns 
evolve—from being rigid and fixed to moving in slow, sweeping 
motions, much like seaweed gently swaying in the ocean. This 
transformation from static to dynamic patterns depends entirely 
on the quality and intensity of the conscious awareness with 
which you engage them. It is the sheer presence of warm 
vigilance—wordless and fundamental—that nudges these patterns 
into a state of flux.



In fact, there are two distinct morphic phenomena at play here.



The first is a natural, ongoing process that has been present 
all along. The energies within your body were already in motion, 
slowly morphing and shifting beneath your conscious radar. The 
only difference now is that you have become aware of 
them—similar to how you become aware of the fridge's hum only 
when it stops. This is a simple realization: you are now 
conscious of what has always been happening in the background.



The second phenomenon, however, is directly initiated by the 
pure light of consciousness and the healing water of awareness. 
When these two forces are consciously applied, the energy 
signatures begin to grow, shift, and morph at a noticeably 
faster and more intense pace. This dynamic process of 
accelerated transformation is precisely the meaning behind the 
previously mentioned quotation:



*"Where the attention goes, the prana (life-energy) flows."*




![](/images/folesansmed.jpg)





The Inner Blocks

As we begin to 
consciously aware this inner body flow, we’ll inevitably notice areas 
that resist movement. These blocked parts often correlate with 
muscular tensions, held tightly within the body. In our normal 
outward-focused state of consciousness, we remain largely 
unaware of these tensions. Yet, as soon as these rigid areas 
collide with the enhanced flow in the more resistance-free 
rivers of energy within us, we become painfully aware of their 
presence.




The key is to persist in gently awaring these unpleasant blocks. 
With time and patience, they will begin to dissolve, much like 
ice melting in the sun.



The Tibetans, with their profound wisdom, offer a beautiful 
metaphor for this process. They liken the human experience to 
that of an ice-body filled with energetic blocks. Through the 
tantric practice of *
[tummo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tummo)*—the 
cultivation of inner heat—this rigid, frozen state gradually 
melts into a flowing water-body, symbolizing liberated energy in fluid 
conscious awareness.



William Blake, in his poetic genius, also speaks to this 
transformative phenomenon:


*"If the doors of 
perception were cleansed,

everything would appear to man as it is: infinite."

*William Blake




Blake's insight echoes the Tibetan 
perspective, reminding us that the infinite oneness of conscious 
awareness is always present, waiting to be revealed through the 
melting away of inner barriers and the cleansing of perception. 
When we dissolve the frozen constructs within, what emerges is 
the boundless flow of life itself.







THE INFINITE ONENESS OF CONSCIOUS AWARENESS****
Now what reveals itself on 
the level of identity when we 
continue to pixellate ourselves into abstract sensations of energy 
in the ever ongoing process of melting inner blocks of 
resistance? 
As we enter deeper levels of 
conscious awareness the various clusters of pixels seem to exchange into a common currency, a united 
abstraction leading into a world with less and less names and 
forms. Metaphorically we could say that we have reached back to 
the primordial ground of stardust. Hence energy, not even 
confined to signatures or clusters becomes more and 
more relevant as a *'lingua franca'*.



In the next little session I invite you to observe and explore the 
sensations coming from the surface of the skin in your hands. 
Now fold your hands and close your eyes once more for a while.



After coming back: Did you notice 
that the skin borders between your hands seem to disappear when 
the energy, as a ball of oneness, makes the hands merge into 
each other? Our external senses tend to divide everything, while 
the internal senses, at least as experienced on a subjective 
level, seem to unify everything. As perhaps the 
most close and intimate sense, the 
[mechanism of skin 
sensationing](/consciousness/the-mystery-of-awareness) seems to be able to do both. As you sit with closed 
eyes, observe how the exteroceptive skin sensations of sitting, 
the places where you are in contact with the pillow or chair, 
seem to blur into oneness. This oneness also includes the 
interoceptive sensations of the inner body in the same area. 
There seems to be an evolutionary link between outer skin 
sensations in a given body area and an enhanced ability to feel 
the deeper 'energies' emerging from the organic life beneath the 
skin.


Now is that not amazing how much we can 'learn' or rather 
unlearn from just simple observations of hands holding hands?



Close your eyes again for a few minutes and verify again for 
yourself how 'awaring' hands in hands plays out in your inner laboratory. Remember to base 
your meditation practice on what you yourself are able to 
verify, not on what I or others say to you. In meditation, we 
get inspired from outside, but we only follow the voice(s) from 
inside.




Let me, in this 
context, make a claim for you to test: Just by the very act of 
closing our eyes, we unify ourselves and, through that, the 
world. This simple act is the beginning of the doors of 
perception being cleansed, leading to life becoming infinite. By 
holding your own hands, you make peace with yourself in the 
morphing, growing ball of abstract energy. Now, can you imagine 
what happens when you hold another person's hand? I leave it to 
you to explore the expanded adventure of holding a friend’s or 
even a stranger’s hands in a state of meditative pixellation.





Pixellation as a 
Lifestyle

**In summary meditative pixellation is in my opinion, the most basic 
form of meditation one can practice. Unlike other meditation 
techniques that create ritual oases—specific time zones 
dedicated solely to meditation—meditative pixellation is more of 
a lifestyle than a technique confined to a specific timeframe. 
It involves cultivating a permanent habit of body-directed 
awareness.




Make it a lifestyle to always feel 
yourself as an abstract flow of energy without reflecting on or 
analyzing your experience. Let me massage this message into my 
habitual unconscious body with a mantric repetition by telling 
it to you: In this ever-ongoing meditation-riff, the goal is to 
keep returning to an innocent 'aha' awareness of the feelings 
and sensations in your inner body, from head to toe. The aim is 
to live a life in what Gurdjieff termed *'constant 
self-remembrance,'* which implies the constant, effortless return 
to a state of self-referential awareness. By engaging with our 
inner world, we cleanse the doors of perception and might here 
rediscover the infinite oneness of conscious awareness. **


This journey begins with a simple act: close your eyes, and 
aware what unfolds.



Here at the end, let me reveal yet another facet of this living 
diamond.



The body pixellates into energy. The energy dissolves into 
presence. The presence dissolves into I AM.




I AM - I AM - I AM
